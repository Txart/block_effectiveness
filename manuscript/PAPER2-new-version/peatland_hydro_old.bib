  abstract = {Using a literature review, we argue that new models of peatland development are needed. Many existing models do not account for potentially important ecohydrological feedbacks, and/or ignore spatial structure and heterogeneity. Existing models, including those that simulate a near total loss of the northern peatland carbon store under a warming climate, may produce misleading results because they rely upon oversimplified representations of ecological and hydrological processes. In this, the first of a pair of papers, we present the conceptual framework for a model of peatland development, DigiBog, which considers peatlands as complex adaptive systems. DigiBog accounts for the interactions between the processes which govern litter production and peat decay, peat soil hydraulic properties, and peatland water-table behaviour, in a novel and genuinely ecohydrological manner. DigiBog consists of a number of interacting submodels, each representing a different aspect of peatland ecohydrology. Here we present in detail the mathematical and computational basis, as well as the implementation and testing, of the hydrological submodel. Remaining submodels are described and analysed in the accompanying paper. Tests of the hydrological submodel against analytical solutions for simple aquifers were highly successful: the greatest deviation between DigiBog and the analytical solutions was 2\DH 83\%. We also applied the hydrological submodel to irregularly shaped aquifers with heterogeneous hydraulic properties\textemdash situations for which no analytical solutions exist\textemdash and found the model's outputs to be plausible.

The store's stability depends on the dynamics of the peatland water table, which in turn depend on peat permeability. We found that an example of the most abundant type of tropical peatland\textemdash ombrotrophic domes\textemdash has an unexpectedly high permeability similar to that of gravel. Using computer simulations of a natural peat dome (NPD) and a ditch-drained peat dome (DPD) we explored how such high permeability affects water tables and peat decay. High permeability has little effect on NPD water tables because of low hydraulic gradients from the center to the margin of the peatland. In contrast, DPD water tables are consistently deep, leaving the upper meter of peat exposed to rapid decay. Our results reveal why ditch drainage precipitates a rapid destabilization of the tropical peatland C store.},

  abstract = {Two regional groundwater flow models (Neckar catchment, Germany, 14,000 km2, and Southern Oue\textasciiacute me\textasciiacute{} Basin, Benin, 11,000 km2) were developed within the framework of the integrated management project `RIVERTWIN' (www.rivertwin.org). Both models were evaluated with respect to the question if the chosen modelling approaches (multi-layered finite difference numerical flow modelling, steady state and transient) are appropriate in view of the existing management problems in the catchments, the data availability and the hydrogeological and hydrological conditions in the basins. It is shown that neither the model in the well-investigated, data-rich basin in Western Europe with its highly developed water related infrastructure, nor the model in the hydrogeologically less well-known and less developed basin in Western Africa provide results that are fully applicable to the main regional management tasks. In the case of the Oue\textasciiacute me\textasciiacute, the groundwater related problems are foremost of local character and therefore cannot be addressed by regional models in a meaningful way. Data scarcity and complex, unfavourable geological conditions (crystalline rocks, discontinuous aquifers) support the conclusion that numerical 3D groundwater flow models are currently not helpful to manage groundwater related management problems in the Oue\textasciiacute me\textasciiacute{} basin. A better understanding of regional hydrological surface and subsurface processes is required first. Methods for a reliable estimation of groundwater recharge and subsequently groundwater availability were identified as the most urgently needed tool for meaningful groundwater management in view of climatic, demographic and land use change. In the Neckar catchment the results of the analysis are less pronounced; here regional groundwater problems could clearly benefit from a physically based 3D model since the hydrogeological system is strictly stratified with several important aquifers in the vertical sequence. As a general conclusion it can be stated that regional scale groundwater flow modelling concepts seem to be difficult to integrate in management systems and difficult to transfer from one basin to another. This means the question of how to represent the groundwater resources appropriately has to be discussed very thoroughly for any new integrated water resources management problem. It is not possible to give a final recommendation on which modelling concept is the most appropriate one in regional integrated modelling and management. Hence, this article is only intended to provide an in depth discussion of the aspects that need to be considered in the process of choosing appropriate modelling concepts.},

  abstract = {Scientists and practitioners agree that integrated water resource management is necessary, with an increasing need for research at the regional scale (103 to 105 km2). At this scale interactions between environmental and human systems are fully developed and global change is linked to local actions. The groundwater-surface water interaction (GW-SW) is of particular interest. Herein we review the scientific journal literature and examine GW-SW at the regional scale. We briefly review all existing literature on GW-SW, then summarise its characteristics at different scales and identify specific challenges of the regional scale. We explore whether GW-SW should be treated differently at regional and local scales. Regional GW-SW is rarely examined in experimental field studies, which almost exclusively cover small areas. However, GW-SW is often integral to large scale coupled models. Thus, we collate information about existing models and their regional applications. Fully coupled, physics-based models have great potential to meet the technical challenges. However, limited data availability hampers the application of complex models at the regional scale and loosely coupled schemes are more widely applied. Many integrated modelling concepts have been published, but none have been applied in a wide range of settings. Thus, it is impossible to compare the performance of different approaches. Comparative analyses of existing regional scale integrated models in the context of different data availability and geographic conditions are needed. Unfortunately, peer-reviewed journal literature no longer provides a representative picture of the subject as models are becoming Btoo big to be published\^ or too pragmatic.},

The key advantage of advection-based algorithms over directed consensus is that the sum of the states is always conserved. This paper includes a formulation of the advection dynamics on directed graphs and a presentation of some of its characteristics, which are compared to the consensus dynamics. We also provide examples of the versatility of the advection dynamics: a formation control and sensor coverage example.},

  abstract = {Peatlands cover many low-lying areas in the tropics. Tropical peatlands are intriguing systems because of their tight coupling between hydrology and carbon storage: They accumulate carbon over thousands of years because of waterlogging, and they remain waterlogged after growing into domed shapes because peat restricts drainage. This feedback between waterlogging and landscape morphology generates landforms with special hydrologic properties that enable simplifications of standard watershed models. In natural tropical peatlands, the water table is always near the surface and infiltration is almost immediate. In addition, water table fluctuations relative to the peat surface are remarkably uniform across tropical peatlands because these peatlands acquire shapes with a uniform topographic wetness index. In this paper, we show that because of these distinctive properties, simple hydrologic models that represent the hydraulic state of a catchment by a scalar quantity that describes total water storage are useful and physically meaningful in tropical peatlands. We demonstrate how to efficiently derive hillslope-scale parameterizations of transmissivity and specific yield as functions of water table height for a tropical peatland from water table, rainfall, and topographic data. Our findings suggest that natural tropical peatland subcatchments could be usefully modeled as single hydrologic response units for river flow and flood forecasting.},

In Southeast Asian peatlands, which have experienced decades of land use change, the exact extent and spatial distribution of drainage canals are unknown. This has prevented regional-scale investigation of the relationships between drainage, land use, and carbon emissions. Here, we create the first regional map of drainage canals using high resolution satellite imagery and a convolutional neural network. We find that drainage is widespread\textemdash occurring in at least 65\% of peatlands and across all land use types. Although previous estimates of peatland carbon emissions have relied on land use as a proxy for drainage, our maps show substantial variation in drainage density within land use types. Subsidence rates are 3.2 times larger in intensively drained areas than in non-drained areas, highlighting the central role of drainage in mediating peat subsidence. Accounting for drainage canals was found to improve a subsidence prediction model by 30\%, suggesting that canals contain information about subsidence not captured by land use alone. Thus, our data set can be used to improve subsidence and associated carbon emissions predictions in peatlands, and to target areas for hydrologic restoration.},

  abstract = {Tropical peatlands are a known source of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere, but their contribution to atmospheric CH4 is poorly constrained. Since the 1980s, extensive areas of the peatlands in Southeast Asia have experienced land-cover change to smallholder agriculture and forest plantations. This land-cover change generally involves lowering of groundwater level (GWL), as well as modification of vegetation type, both of which potentially influence CH4 emissions. We measured CH4 exchanges at the landscape scale using eddy covariance towers over two land-cover types in tropical peatland in Sumatra, Indonesia: (a) a natural forest and (b) an Acacia crassicarpa plantation. Annual CH4 exchanges over the natural forest (9.1 {$\pm$} 0.9 g CH4 m-2 year-1) were around twice as high as those of the Acacia plantation (4.7 {$\pm$} 1.5 g CH4 m-2 year-1). Results highlight that tropical peatlands are significant CH4 sources, and probably have a greater impact on global atmospheric CH4 concentrations than previously thought. Observations showed a clear diurnal variation in CH4 exchange over the natural forest where the GWL was higher than 40 cm below the ground surface. The diurnal variation in CH4 exchanges was strongly correlated with associated changes in the canopy conductance to water vapor, photosynthetic photon flux density, vapor pressure deficit, and air temperature. The absence of a comparable diurnal pattern in CH4 exchange over the Acacia plantation may be the result of the GWL being consistently below the root zone. Our results, which are among the first eddy covariance CH4 exchange data reported for any tropical peatland, should help to reduce the uncertainty in the estimation of CH4 emissions from a globally important ecosystem, provide a more complete estimate of the impact of land-cover change on tropical peat, and develop science-based peatland management practices that help to minimize greenhouse gas emissions.},

  abstract = {The world's largest area of tropical peatland ecosystems is found in South-East Asia. These peatlands have globally significant carbon stocks and play an important role in regional and global climate systems. Despite the valuable social and economic services and ecosystem biodiversity these tropical peatlands provide, misguided land use policies have resulted in widespread peatland degradation in the region during the past 20 years. This paper reviews the drivers of peatland degradation in South-East Asia and confirms that logging, conversion to industrial plantations, drainage, and recurrent fires are the principal direct drivers of peatland degradation in South-East Asia, and that these drivers are compounded by a complex mix of indirect socioeconomic, policy- and climate change-related factors. The review concludes by noting that in order to address the problem of peatland degradation, we first need to know more about how to design and assess ``successful'' peatland restoration initiatives, and what regulatory and policy interventions are likely to improve peatland conservation and restoration outcomes in the South-East Asian region.},

A number of restoration initiatives have been attempted to address this degradation yet, to date, there has been little coherent or rigorous reflection on the effectiveness of these interventions. This paper examines the barriers to peatland restoration in Indonesia and reviews the techniques so far used to restore degraded peatland in the tropics. Direct barriers to peatland restoration in Indonesia include altered peat topography, peatland drainage, the presence of invasive ferns and shrub species, repeated fires, and flooding risks. Indirect barriers include climate change, inconsistent land-use policy and lack of alternative livelihood options. We highlight that most restoration activities carried out to date have been small-scale trials and the restoration techniques used have included canal blocking, seedling transplantation, and promotion of seed dispersal. We suggest that successful peatland restoration in Indonesia is as much dependent on meaningful land use policy and governance reform as it is on the technical effectiveness of specific restoration methods.},

  abstract = {This article explores the hydrological constraints on the existence of forested peat domes (peat swamp forests) in the humid tropics, the self-regulation mechanisms that enable them to persist and the implications for restoration of damaged domes. The most important requirement for the preservation of peat is permanent saturation by water. The variable input of precipitation must be translated into a constant water supply to the peat mound. In intact tropical peat swamp domes, water is stored above the peat surface in depressions between hummocks that surround tree trunks and between spreading buttress roots. This above-ground water store is analogous to the water stored in the loose upper layer of peat and vegetation in Sphagnum bogs. The horizontal differentiation of the peat swamp forest floor into hummocks with limited hydraulic conductivity and depressions with high storage capacity resembles the hummock-hollow patterning of these Sphagnum bogs. Hummocks and other surface elements functionally resemble V-notch weirs that regulate water availability. Buttressed trees play a key role in providing the structural elements for hydrological self-regulation. An additional level of regulation is found in the concentric zonation of forest types with increased presence of buttressed trees on steeper margins. Conservation and restoration efforts should take into account the interrelationships between trees, water and peat and the hydrological feedbacks that operate as a consequence.},

  abstract = {Distributed hydrologic models capable of simulating fully-coupled surface water and groundwater flow are increasingly used to examine problems in the hydrologic sciences. Several techniques are currently available to couple the surface and subsurface; the two most frequently employed approaches are first-order exchange coefficients (a.k.a., the surface conductance method) and enforced continuity of pressure and flux at the surface-subsurface boundary condition. The effort reported here examines the parameter sensitivity of simulated hydrologic response for the first-order exchange coefficients at a well-characterized field site using the fully coupled Integrated Hydrology Model (InHM ). This investigation demonstrates that the first-order exchange coefficients can be selected such that the simulated hydrologic response is insensitive to the parameter choice, while simulation time is considerably reduced. Alternatively, the ability to choose a firstorder exchange coefficient that intentionally decouples the surface and subsurface facilitates concept-development simulations to examine real-world situations where the surface-subsurface exchange is impaired. While the parameters comprising the first-order exchange coefficient cannot be directly estimated or measured, the insensitivity of the simulated flow system to these parameters (when chosen appropriately) combined with the ability to mimic actual physical processes suggests that the first-order exchange coefficient approach can be consistent with a physics-based framework.

  abstract = {Disentangling land-use and climatic influences on peat subsidence, and establishing the long-term trajectory of subsidence, are necessary to determine the future economic and environmental sustainability of managed peatland landscapes. While many peatlands in temperate regions such as Europe have been drained for centuries, those of Southeast Asia have mostly been drained for agriculture and forestry practices within the last 30 years. These areas are subsiding rapidly, but few long-term subsidence records exist, and it is unclear whether currently high subsidence rates will be maintained in future. Furthermore, large-scale climate fluctuations associated with the El Nin\texttildelow o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) exert a strong year-to-year influence on rainfall rates, affecting water table depth dynamics in both managed and intact peatlands. In this study, we analysed data collected over more than a decade of subsidence measurements from over 400 plantation and forest plots in Sumatra, Indonesia, including a unique set of 62 sites that have been continuously monitored since 2007. We show that spatial and temporal variations in subsidence rates are primarily determined by water table depth. We also find evidence of declining subsidence rates as a function of time since initial drainage, consistent with previous instrumental records from high-latitude peatlands and recent satellite data from tropical peatlands. Subsidence rates over the study period were strongly affected by the large ENSO/IOD-linked drought event in 2015\textendash 16, which caused an acceleration of subsidence across all sites. In plantation areas, we estimate that this climate perturbation caused around 14 \% of subsidence observed over a twelve year period. At interior forest sites this rose to 32 \%, and we found little evidence of ecosystem recovery to the end of 2018. This raises the possibility that repeated extreme droughts in the region could lead to long-term degradation of peat swamp forest ecosystems.},

Cultivation of drained peatlands now supports the livelihoods of large numbers of people, and the ongoing economic development of countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia. However, peat subsidence linked to plantation drainage represents both an environmental and a socio-economic challenge, associated with elevated CO2 emissions, impacts on adjacent forest habitat, and longterm changes in plantation drainability. Whilst the fundamental challenges presented by peat subsidence are broadly recognised, the long-term rates and the potential for mitigation or avoidance of subsidence remain uncertain. We analysed over 2000 site-years of subsidence measurements from 312 sites in Sumatra, Indonesia, collected under Acacia pulpwood plantation and adjacent native forest, representing the largest peat subsidence dataset published to date. Subsidence averaged 4.3 cm yr-1 in the Acacia plantations, and extended at least 300 m into adjacent forest. Mean water table depth (WTD) was the best predictor of subsidence rate in both plantation and forest areas. We did not find conclusive evidence that subsidence was intrinsically faster under Acacia plantation than under native forest or (by comparison with previous studies) oil palm plantations for the same level of drainage. Our results suggest that raising average WTDs to the Indonesian Government's 40 cm target could \textendash{} if practically and economically viable means of achieving this can be developed \textendash{} reduce current plantation subsidence rates by 25\textendash 30\%. Whilst some degree of peat subsidence under any form of plantation management may be unavoidable, these reductions would \textendash{} if achieved at scale \textendash{} both increase the economic lifetime of the plantations, and simultaneously deliver reductions in CO2 emissions of national and global significance.},

Yet in Indonesia and Malaysia, home to 56\% of the world's tropical peatland, they are subject to considerable developmental pressures, including widespread drainage to support agricultural needs. In this article, we review the ecology behind the functioning and ecosystem services provided by PSFs, with a particular focus on hydrological processes as well as the role of the forest itself in maintaining those services. Drawing on this, we review the suitability of current policy frameworks and consider the efficacy of their implementation. We suggest that policies in Malaysia and Indonesia are often based around the narrative of oil palm and other major monocrops as drivers of prosperity and development. However, we also argue that this narrative is also being supported by a priori claims concerning the possibility of sustainability of peat swamp exploitation via drainage-based agriculture through the adherence to best management practices. We discuss how this limits their efficacy, uptake and the political will towards enforcement. Further, we consider how both narratives (prosperity and sustainability) clearly exclude important considerations concerning the ecosystem value of tropical PSFs which are dependent on their unimpacted hydrology. Current research clearly shows that the actual debate should be focused not on how to develop drainage-based plantations sustainably, but on whether the sustainable conversion to drainage-based systems is possible at all.},

Such problems are usually solved by domain decomposition methods, but these can be difficult to implement on unstructured grids or when the boundaries between subdomains have a complicated geometry. Gordon and Gordon have shown that Bj\"orck and Elfving's (sequential) CGMN algorithm and their own block-parallel CARP-CG are very robust and efficient on strongly convection dominated cases (but without discontinuous coefficients). They have also shown that scaling the equations by dividing each equation by the L2-norm of its coefficients, called ``geometric row scaling'' (GRS), improves the convergence properties of Bi-CGSTAB and GMRES on nonsymmetric systems with discontinuous coefficients, provided the convection terms are only small to moderate. Given a system Ax = b, it is shown that if C is obtained from A by applying GRS, then the diagonal elements of CCT are larger than the off-diagonal ones, so the normal equations system is manageable. These two operations are inherent in the Kaczmarz algorithm, and hence also in CGMN and CARP-CG (which are CG-accelerations of Kaczmarz). It is shown that these two methods are also very effective on systems with discontinuous coefficients derived from strongly convection dominated elliptic PDEs. CGNR and CGNE also benefit greatly from this approach, but they are much less efficient.},

The model was applied to the drainage network of a peatland catchment in Eastern Finland over a period of 15 months. Because flow resistance in the ditches depended strongly on flow conditions, flow resistance (Manning's n) was introduced as a function of discharge. The model was calibrated and validated against field data and the simulation results were further applied to assess erosion risk. The highest risk of erosion occurred during long lasting flows induced by snowmelt at ditch sections with a steep slope and a large upstream area. These model results can aid in the design and siting of water protection measures within the drained area.},

  abstract = {The peat forests of Indonesia have experienced extensive deforestation and degradation over recent decades. High demand for Indonesian timber and plantation development has driven large-scale draining and clearing of peat forest, resulting in extensive fires and smoke haze problems across the region. These fires caused more than 100,000 premature deaths in 2015 alone, increased the pressure on several already threatened species, and placed Indonesia among the top greenhouse gas emitting countries globally. In response, the Indonesian government has launched an initiative to restore more than 2 million ha of peatland between now and 2020. Although there is a substantial body of academic literature that deals with technical aspects of tropical peatland restoration, little is published on the costs of tropical peatland restoration activities. In this study, we examine the case of peatland restoration in the provinces of Kalimantan, Sumatra, and Papua in Indonesia, and propose a restoration activity classification scheme based on fire, drainage, and logging history of peatland areas. We use this scheme to identify the restoration activity needs of different areas and then develop a preliminary gross financial cost estimate for the restoration activities proposed under the national 2-million-ha peatland restoration initiative. We find that it is likely to cost more than US\$4.6 billion to complete the national 2-million-ha restoration initiative, which is substantially more than the funds currently allocated to the challenge across Indonesian and international donor budgets.},

  abstract = {In Southeast Asia, peatland is widely distributed and has accumulated a massive amount of soil carbon, coexisting with peat swamp forest (PSF). The peatland, however, has been rapidly degraded by deforestation, fires, and drainage for the last two decades. Such disturbances change hydrological conditions, typically groundwater level (GWL), and accelerate oxidative peat decomposition. Evapotranspiration (ET) is a major determinant of GWL, whereas information on the ET of PSF is limited. Therefore, we measured ET using the eddy covariance technique for 4\textendash 6 years between 2002 and 2009, including El Nin\textasciitilde o and La Nin\textasciitilde a events, at three sites in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. The sites were different in disturbance degree: a PSF with little drainage (UF), a heavily drained PSF (DF), and a drained burnt ex-PSF (DB); GWL was significantly lowered at DF, especially in the dry season. The ET showed a clear seasonal variation with a peak in the mid-dry season and a large decrease in the late dry season, mainly following seasonal variation in net radiation (Rn). The Rn drastically decreased with dense smoke from peat fires in the late dry season. Annual ET forced to close energy balance for 4 years was 1636 \AE{} 53, 1553 \AE{} 117, and 1374 \AE{} 75 mm yr\`A1 (mean \AE{} 1 standard deviation), respectively, at UF, DF, and DB. The undrained PSF (UF) had high and rather stable annual ET, independently of El Nin\textasciitilde o and La Nin\textasciitilde a events, in comparison with other tropical rainforests. The minimum monthly-mean GWL explained 80\% of interannual variation in ET for the forest sites (UF and DF); the positive relationship between ET and GWL indicates that drainage by a canal decreased ET at DF through lowering GWL. In addition, ET was decreased by 16\% at DB in comparison with UF chiefly because of vegetation loss through fires.},

The new equations are in the flux-gradient conservation form and transfer portions of both the hydrostatic pressure force and the gravitational force from the source term to the conservative flux term. This approach prevents irregular channel topography from creating an inherently non-smooth source term for momentum. The derivation introduces an analytical approximation of the free surface across a finite-volume element (e.g., linear, parabolic) with a weighting function for quadrature with bottom topography. This new free-surface/topography approach provides a single term that approximates the integrated piezometric pressure over a control volume that can be split between the source and the conservative flux terms without introducing new variables within the discretization. The resulting conservative finite-volume equations are written entirely in terms of flow rates, cross-sectional areas, and water surface elevations \textendash{} without using the bottom slope (S0). The new SaintVenant equation form is (1) inherently conservative, as compared to non-conservative finite-difference forms, and (2) inherently well-balanced for irregular topography, as compared to conservative finite-volume forms using the Cunge\textendash Liggett approach that rely on two integrations of topography. It is likely that this new equation form will be more tractable for large-scale simulations of river networks and urban drainage systems with highly variable topography as it ensures the inhomogeneous source term of the momentum conservation equation is Lipschitz smooth as long as the solution variables are smooth.},

  abstract = {Ditch blocking in blanket peatlands is common as part of peatland restoration. The effects of ditch-blocking on flow regimes and nearby water tables were examined in a field trial. After an initial six month monitoring period, eight ditches had peat dams installed 10 m apart along their entire length (dammed), four of these ditches were also partially infilled through bank reprofiling (reprofiled). Four ditches were left open with no dams or reprofiling (open). These 12 ditches and the surrounding peat were monitored for a further 4 years. An initial five-fold reduction in discharge occurred in the dammed and the reprofiled ditches with the displaced water being diverted to overland flow and pathways away from the ditches. However, there was a gradual change over time in ditch flow regime in subsequent years, with the overall volume of water leaving the dammed and the reprofiled ditches increasing per unit of rainfall to around twice that which occurred in the first year after blocking. Hence monitoring for greater than one year is important for understanding hydrological impacts of peatland restoration. Overland flow and flow in the upper \textasciitilde 4 cm of peat was common and occurred in the inter-ditch areas for over half of the time after ditch blocking. There was strong evidence that topographic boundaries of small ditch catchments, despite being defined using a highresolution LiDAR-based terrain model, were not always equivalent to actual catchment areas. Hence caution is needed when upscaling area-based fluxes, such as aquatic carbon fluxes, from smaller scale studies including those using ditches and small streams. The effect of ditch blocking on local water tables was spatially highly variable but small overall (timeweighted mean effect {$<$} 2 cm). Practitioners seeking to raise water tables through peatland restoration should first be informed either by prior measurement of water tables or by spatial modelling to show whether the peatland already has shallow water tables or whether there are locations which could potentially undergo large water-table recoveries.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Conversion of tropical peatlands to agriculture leads to a release of carbon from previously stable, long-term storage, resulting in land subsidence that can be a surrogate measure of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. We present an analysis of recent large-scale subsidence monitoring studies in Acacia and oil palm plantations on peatland in SE Asia, and compare the findings with previous studies. Subsidence in the first 5 yr after drainage was found to be 142 cm, of which 75 cm occurred in the first year. After 5 yr, the subsidence rate in both plantation types, at average water table depths of 0.7 m, remained constant at around 5 cm yr-1. The results confirm that primary consolidation contributed substantially to total subsidence only in the first year after drainage, that secondary consolidation was negligible, and that the amount of compaction was also much reduced within 5 yr. Over 5 yr after drainage, 75 \% of cumulative subsidence was caused by peat oxidation, and after 18 yr this was 92 \%. The average rate of carbon loss over the first 5 yr was 178 t CO2eq ha-1 yr-1, which reduced to 73 t CO2eq ha-1 yr-1 over subsequent years, potentially resulting in an average loss of 100 t CO2eq ha-1 yr-1 over 25 yr. Part of the observed range in subsidence and carbon loss values is explained by differences in water table depth, but vegetation cover and other factors such as addition of fertilizers also influence peat oxidation. A relationship with groundwater table depth shows that subsidence and carbon loss are still considerable even at the highest water levels theoretically possible in plantations. This implies that improved plantation water management will reduce these impacts by 20 \% at most, relative to current conditions, and that high rates of carbon loss and land subsidence are inevitable consequences of conversion of forested tropical peatlands to other land uses.},

  abstract = {Emission of CO2 from tropical peatlands is an important component of the global carbon budget. Over days to months, these fluxes are largely controlled by water table depth. However, the diurnal cycle is less well understood, in part, because most measurements have been collected daily at midday. We used an automated chamber system to make hourly measurements of peat surface CO2 emissions from chambers root-cut to 30 cm. We then used these data to disentangle the relationship between temperature, water table and heterotrophic respiration (Rhet). We made two central observations. First, we found strong diurnal cycles in CO2 flux and near-surface peat temperature ({$<$}10 cm depth), both peaking at midday. The magnitude of diurnal oscillations was strongly influenced by shading and water table depth, highlighting the limitations of relying on daytime measurements and/or a single correction factor to remove daytime bias in flux measurements. Second, we found mean daily Rhet had a strong linear relationship to the depth of the water table, and under flooded conditions, Rhet was small and constant. We used this relationship between Rhet and water table depth to estimate carbon export from both Rhet and dissolved organic carbon over the course of a year based on water table records. Rhet dominates annual carbon export, demonstrating the potential for peatland drainage to increase regional CO2 emissions. Finally, we discuss an apparent incompatibility between hourly and daily average observations of CO2 flux, water table and temperature: water table and daily average flux data suggest that CO2 is produced across the entire unsaturated peat profile, whereas temperature and hourly flux data appear to suggest that CO2 fluxes are controlled by very near surface peat. We explore how temperature-, moistureand gas transport-related mechanisms could cause mean CO2 emissions to increase linearly with water table depth and also have a large diurnal cycle.},

This study investigated the factors controlling the CO2 efflux and quantified the annual cumulative CO2 emissions through soil respiration and heterotrophic respiration, which is equivalent to oxidative peat decomposition. Soil respiration was measured in close-to-tree ({$<$}2.5m, CT) and far-from-tree ({$>$}3m, FT) plots, and heterotrophic respiration was measured in root-cut (RC) plots by a trenching method. The daily mean CO2 efflux values (mean{$\pm$}1 standard deviation) were 2.80{$\pm$}2.18, 1.59{$\pm$}1.18, and 1.94{$\pm$}1.58{$\mu$}molm-2s-1 in the CT, FT, and RC plots, respectively. Daily mean CO2 efflux increased exponentially as the groundwater level or water-filled pore space decreased, indicating that oxidative peat decomposition and gas diffusion in the soil increased due to enhanced aeration resulting from lower groundwater levels. Mean annual gap-filled CO2 emissions were 1.03{$\pm$}0.53, 0.59{$\pm$}0.26, and 0.69{$\pm$}0.21kgCm-2 yr-1 in the CT, FT, and RC plots, respectively. Soil CO2 emissions were significantly higher in the CT plots (P{$<$}0.05), but did not differ significantly between the FT and RC plots. This implies that root respiration was negligible in the FT plots. Heterotrophic respiration accounted for 66\% of soil respiration. Annual CO2 emissions through both soil and heterotrophic respiration were smaller than those of other oil palm plantations on tropical peat, possibly due to the higher groundwater levels, land compaction, and continuous measurement of soil CO2 efflux in this study. Mean annual total subsidence was 1.55 to 1.62cmyr-1, of which oxidative peat decomposition accounted for 72 to 74\%. In conclusion, water management to raise groundwater levels would mitigate soil CO2 emissions from oil palm plantations on tropical peatland.},

Construction of drainage canals is associated with conversion to other land uses, especially plantations of oil palm and pulpwood trees, and with widespread illegal logging to facilitate timber transport. A lowering of the groundwater level leads to an increase in oxidation and subsidence of peat. Therefore, the groundwater level is the main control on carbon dioxide emissions from peatlands. Restoring the peatland hydrology is the only way to prevent peat oxidation and mitigate CO2 emissions. In this study we present a strategy for improved planning of rewetting measures by dam constructions. The study area is a vast peatland with limited accessibility in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Field inventory and remote sensing data are used to generate a detailed 3D model of the peat dome and a hydrological model predicts the rise in groundwater levels once dams have been constructed. Successful rewetting of a 590 km{$^2$} large area of drained peat swamp forest could result in mitigated emissions of 1.4\textendash 1.6 Mt CO2 yearly. This equates to 6\% of the carbon dioxide emissions by civil aviation in the European Union in 2006 and can be achieved with relatively small efforts and at low costs. The proposed methodology allows a detailed planning of hydrological restoration of peatlands with interesting impacts on carbon trading for the voluntary carbon market.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Peat surface CO2 emission, groundwater table depth and peat temperature were monitored for two years along transects in an Acacia plantation on thick tropical peat ({$>$}4 m) in Sumatra, Indonesia. A total of 2300 emission measurements were taken at 144 locations, over a 2 year period. The autotrophic root respiration component of CO2 emission was separated from heterotrophic emission caused by peat oxidation in three ways: (i) by comparing CO2 emissions within and beyond the tree rooting zone, (ii) by comparing CO2 emissions with and without peat trenching (i.e. cutting any roots remaining in the peat beyond the tree rooting zone), and (iii) by comparing CO2 emissions before and after Acacia tree harvesting. On average, the contribution of autotrophic respiration to daytime CO2 emission was 21\% along transects in mature tree stands. At locations 0.5 m from trees this was up to 80\% of the total emissions, but it was negligible at locations more than 1.3 m away. This means that CO2 emission measurements well away from trees were free of any autotrophic respiration contribution and thus represent only heterotrophic emissions. We found daytime mean annual CO2 emission from peat oxidation alone of 94 t ha-1 y-1 at a mean water table depth of 0.8 m, and a minimum emission value of 80 t ha-1 y-1 after correction for the effect of diurnal temperature fluctuations, which may result in a 14.5\% reduction of the daytime emission. There is a positive correlation between mean long-term water table depth and peat oxidation CO2 emission. However, no such relation is found for instantaneous emission/water table depth within transects and it is clear that factors other than water table depth also affect peat oxidation and total CO2 emissions. The increase in the temperature of the surface peat due to plantation establishment may explain over 50\% of peat oxidation emissions. Our study sets a standard for greenhouse gas flux studies from tropical peatlands under different forms of agricultural land management. It is the first to purposefully quantify heterotrophic CO2 emissions resulting from tropical peat decomposition by separating these from autotrophic emissions. It also provides the most scientifically- and statistically-rigorous study to date of CO2 emissions resulting from anthropogenic modification of this globally significant carbon rich ecosystem. Our findings indicate that past studies have underestimated emissions from peatland plantations, with important implications for the scale of greenhouse gas emissions arising from land use change, particularly in the light of current, rapid agricultural conversion of peatlands in the Southeast Asian region.},

  abstract = {Sebangau National Park is a tropical peat swamp forest previously used for logging activities (illegal and legal) between the 1970s until 2006. Logging activities created the canal networks used for transportation of logs and led to over-drainage in peatland. Two-hundred and seventy three canals were recorded over a total length of 673.486 km in nine locations at the Sebangau National Park. Restoration of degraded peatland area started by rewetting peatland using canal blocking technique in which the dam increases the water table level. This technique was implemented in the Bulan River, Katingan Catchment, southwest of Sebangau National Park. The location of canal blocking were determined using canal elevation, estimated every 25 cm by combining field survey and imagery data from digital terrain model. Final decision on canal blocking was reached through compromised discussions with the villagers in order for them to understand the aims of canal blocking and to come to an agreement with the beneficiaries of non-timber forest products and fisheries around the affected area. The canal blocking have resulted in 645 dams being built along the 92 canals with total length measuring 226 km. Measurement impacts of canal blocking were monitored by monthly data of surface water level (swl) in 16 locations and groundwater level (gwl) in 112 pipes for the period from June 2013 to July 2015. The analysis shows that canal blocking effect is significantly positively correlated with water level controlled by rainfall (p {$<$} 0.05). The positive impact after the canal blocking is on the increase of swl (mean of swl: before = -33.966 cm, after = -26.099 cm; rainfall = 191.0398 mm) and gwl (mean of gwl: before = -19.442 cm, after = -11.925 cm; rainfall = 191.0398 mm). Other efforts that should be done to promote restoration include peat fire prevention, reforestation and community involvement.},

  abstract = {The form and functioning of peatlands depend strongly on their hydrological status, but there are few data available on the hydraulic properties of tropical peatlands. In particular, the saturated hydraulic conductivity (K) has not previously been measured in neotropical peatlands. Piezometer slug tests were used to measure K at two depths (50 and 90 cm) in three contrasting forested peatlands in the Peruvian Amazon: Quistococha, San Jorge and Buena Vista. Measured K at 50 cm depth varies between 0.00032 and 0.11 cm s\`A1, and at 90 cm, it varies between 0.00027 and 0.057 cm s\`A1. Measurements of K taken from different areas of Quistococha showed that spatial heterogeneity accounts for \textasciitilde 20\% of the within-site variance and that depth is a good predictor of K. However, K did not vary significantly with depth at Buena Vista and San Jorge. Statistical analysis showed that \textasciitilde 18\% of the variance in the K data can be explained by between-site differences. Simulations using a simple hydrological model suggest that the relatively high K values could lead to lowering of the water table by {$>$}10 cm within \textasciitilde 48 m of the peatland edge for domed peatlands, if subjected to a drought lasting 30 days. However, under current climatic conditions, even with high K, peatlands would be unable to shed the large amount of water entering the system via rainfall through subsurface flow alone. We conclude that most of the water leaves these peatlands via overland flow and/or evapotranspiration. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {The spectrum of this survey turns on the evaluation of various existing theoretical combining models, when invoked within the internal boundary condition management at a junction. Based on the assumption that: when the Froude number is low (i.e. the flow is subcritical), the energy equation at the junction can be approximated by the stages heads equality. Actual literature and many commercial packages rather use this concept for the treatment of the junction's internal boundary handling because it is easy to implement and it avoids the solving of nonlinear equations. In the last decade, many nonlinear combining models, based on the momentum conservation through the junction, have been reported. However, using them to operate within the internal boundary condition treatment of an open-channel confluence has not yet been investigated. Hence, this research focuses on studying the practical aspect of several combining models, once applied within the junction's internal boundary management. Therefore, the recent nonlinear models of Gurram, Hsu and Shabayek have been briefly detailed together with the traditional concept of assuming water stages equality at the junction. Subsequently, an experimental examination was performed according to available experiments as mean to pre-evaluate (separately at the junction) the four junction models in the steady state. Moreover, according to the latter inspection the attention was constrained to study the effect of high/low subcritical Froude number at the junction. Finally, two hypothetical hydraulic problems were defined and computed in order to exhibit the performance of these junction models when used to contend the junction's internal boundary handling. The problems involved: (a) steady and transient flows; (b) high and low (subcritical) Froude number at the junction. Supported by the experimental and numerical investigations, it can be concluded that even while the Froude number spectrum is subcritical, precautions have to be taken when dealing with the concept of energy heads equality, notably for a Froude higher than 0.35 at the junction.},

Large fires occur regularly, destroying agricultural crops and forest, emitting large amounts of CO2 and air pollutants, resulting in adverse health effects. In order to reduce fire, the Indonesian government has committed to restore 2.49 Mha of degraded peatland, with an estimated cost of US\$3.2-7 billion. Here we combine fire emissions and land cover data to estimate the 2015 fires, the largest in recent years, resulted in economic losses totalling US\$28 billion, whilst the six largest fire events between 2004 and 2015 caused a total of US\$93.9 billion in economic losses. We estimate that if restoration had already been completed, the area burned in 2015 would have been reduced by 6\%, reducing CO2 emissions by 18\%, and PM2.5 emissions by 24\%, preventing 12,000 premature mortalities. Peatland restoration could have resulted in economic savings of US\$8.4 billion for 2004\textendash 2015, making it a cost-effective strategy for reducing the impacts of peatland fires to the environment, climate and human health.}

The production and emission of CH4 are strongly influenced by the diffusion of oxygen into the soil and of CH4 from the soil to the atmosphere, respectively. This diffusion, in turn, is controlled by the structure of macropore networks. The characterization of peat pore structure and connectivity through complex network theory approaches can give conceptual insight into how the relationship between the microscale pore space properties and CH4 emissions on a macroscopic scale is shaped. The evolution of the pore space that is connected to the atmosphere can also be conceptualized through a pore network modeling approach. Pore regions isolated from the atmosphere may further develop into anaerobic pockets, which are local hotspots of CH4 production in unsaturated peat. In this study, we extracted interconnecting macropore networks from three-dimensional X-ray micro-computed tomography (\textmu CT) images of peat samples and evaluated local and global connectivity metrics for the networks. We also simulated the water retention characteristics of the peat samples using a pore network modeling approach and compared the simulation results with measured water retention characteristics.},

Over the past several decades, tropical peatlands have experienced high rates of deforestation and conversion, which is often associated with lowering the water table and peat burning, releasing large amounts of carbon stored in peat to the atmosphere. We present the first model of long-term carbon accumulation in tropical peatlands by modifying the Holocene Peat Model (HPM), which has been successfully applied to northern temperate peatlands. Tropical HPM (HPMTrop) is a one-dimensional, nonlinear, dynamic model with a monthly time step that simulates peat mass remaining in annual peat cohorts over millennia as a balance between monthly vegetation inputs (litter) and monthly decomposition. Key model parameters were based on published data on vegetation characteristics, including net primary production partitioned into leaves, wood, and roots; and initial litter decomposition rates. HPMTrop outputs are generally consistent with field observations from Indonesia. Simulated long-term carbon accumulation rates for 11 000-year-old inland, and 5 000-year-old coastal peatlands were about 0.3 and 0.59 Mg C ha\`A1 yr\`A1, and the resulting peat carbon stocks at the end of the 11 000-year and 5 000year simulations were 3300 and 2900 Mg C ha\`A1, respectively. The simulated carbon loss caused by coastal peat swamp forest conversion into oil palm plantation with periodic burning was 1400 Mg C ha\`A1 over 100 years, which is equivalent to \textasciitilde 2900 years of C accumulation in a hectare of coastal peatlands.},

In the study area, hummocks and hollows were neither oriented in relation to the water flow nor did their spatial distribution seem to follow any other regularly repeated patterning. Combined data from long-term water table measurements and ground surface elevation mapping showed that for most of the year more than half of the soil surface is above the ground water table. The highest and lowest water table levels lasted a relatively short time with less fluctuation during higher than low water tables. Vegetation was concentrated on elevated surfaces such that tree seedlings were found at all elevations whereas mature trees were more abundant at higher elevations. We expect both flooding-induced oxygen deficiency in hollows and better nutrient availability in hummocks to steer the vegetation growth towards higher surfaces. The patterns of microtopography and vegetation between the areas closer to the margins versus the more central locations on the peat dome were similar.},

Growth response depends on weather conditions, stand and site characteristics, management and biogeochemical processes. We constructed a SUSI-simulator (SUoSImulaattori, in Finnish), which describes hydrology, stand growth and nutrient availability under different management, site types and weather conditions. In the model development and sensitivity analysis, we used water table (WT) and stand growth data from 11 Scots pine stands. The simulator was validated against a larger dataset collected from boreal drained peatlands in Finland. In validation, SUSI was shown to predict WT and stand growth well. Stand growth was mainly limited by inadequate potassium supply, and in Sphagnum peats by low oxygen availability. Model application was demonstrated for ditch network maintenance (DNM) by comparing stand growth with shallow (-0.3 m) and deep ditches (-0.9 m): The growth responses varied between 0.5 and 3.5 m3 ha-1 in five years, which is comparable to experimental results. SUSI can promote sustainable peatland management and help in avoiding unnecessary drainage operations and associated environmental effects, such as increased carbon emissions, peat subsidence, and nutrient leaching.

Intensive drainage and the resulting low water tables (WT) increase carbon emissions, peat subsidence, fire risk and nutrient export to water courses, whilst increasing nutrient availability for plant uptake from peat mineralization. In the plantations, hydrology, stand growth, carbon and nutrient balance, and peat subsidence are connected forming a complex dynamic system, which can be thoroughly understood by dynamic process models. We developed the Plantation Simulator to describe the effect of drainage, silviculture, fertilization, and weed control on the above-mentioned processes and to find production schemes that are environmentally and economically viable. The model successfully predicted measured peat subsidence, which was used as a proxy for stand total mass balance. Computed nutrient balances indicated that the main growth-limiting factor was phosphorus (P) supply, and the P balance was affected by site index, mortality rate and WT. In a scenario assessment, where WT was raised from -0.80 m to -0.40 m the subsidence rate decreased from 4.4 to 3.3 cm yr-1, and carbon loss from 17 to 9 Mg ha-1 yr-1. P balance shifted from marginally positive to negative suggesting that additional P fertilization is needed to maintain stand productivity as a trade-off for reducing C emissions.},

The results show that the rainfall in the southern Sumatra and southern Java Islands, which face the Indian Ocean, was positively correlated with the negative IOD, whereas the rainfall in northwestern Sumatra was positively correlated with the positive IOD. In eastern Indonesia, the rainfall was positively correlated with La Ni\~na. The PDO index was also strongly correlated with the rainfall in this region. In central Indonesia, seasonal variations due to monsoons are predominant, and the rainfall exhibited strong negative and positive correlations with the MEI and NINO.WEST, respectively, indicating that high rainfall occurred during strong La Ni\~na episodes. The highly negative and positive correlations with the MEI and NINO.WEST, respectively, in central Indonesia led us to analyze the impacts of Indonesian seas on the rainfall in the region. Using four synoptic-scale scenarios, we investigated the relative residence time of Indonesian seawater along the pathways associated with the Pacific-Indian hydraulic head difference. The results show that when both the western Pacific and eastern Indian Oceans are warm (positive NINO.WEST and negative DMI), the rainfall intensity over central Indonesia is strongest.},

  abstract = {Draining deforested tropical peat swamp forests (PSFs) converts greenhouse gas (GHG) sinks to sources and increases the likelihood of fire hazards. Rewetting deforested and drained PSFs before revegetation is expected to reverse this outcome. This study aims to quantify the GHG emissions of deforested PSFs that have been (a) reforested, (b) converted into oil palm, or (c) replanted with rubber. Before rewetting, heterotrophic soil respiration in reforested, oil palm, and rubber plantation areas were 48.91 \&plusmn; 4.75 Mg CO2 ha\&minus;1 yr\&minus;1, 54.98 \&plusmn; 1.53 Mg CO2 ha\&minus;1 yr\&minus;1, and 67.67 \&plusmn; 2.13 Mg CO2 ha\&minus;1 yr\&minus;1, respectively. After rewetting, this decreased substantially by 21\%, 36\%, and 39\%. Conversely, rewetting drained landscapes that used to be methane (CH4) sinks converted them into CH4 sources; almost twice as much methane was emitted after rewetting. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions tended to decrease; in nitrogen-rich rubber plantations, N2O emissions halved; in nitrogen-poor reforested areas, emissions reduced by up to a quarter after rewetting. Overall, rewetting reduced the net emissions up to 15.41 Mg CO2-eq ha\&minus;1 yr\&minus;1 (25\%) in reforested, 18.36 Mg CO2-eq ha\&minus;1 yr\&minus;1 (18\%) in oil palm, and 28.87 Mg CO2-eq ha\&minus;1 yr\&minus;1 (17\%) in rubber plantation areas.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the Simulation Program for River Networks (SPRINT) that is proposed as a tool for studying Continental River Dynamics (CRD), the solution of physics-based equations for large-scale river networks. Existing coupled hydrologic/hydraulic models have been unable to solve the full Saint-Venant equations for river networks larger than O(103) elements, but continental scales require 106e107 elements. The new model solves the full nonlinear Saint-Venant equations for one-dimensional (1D) unsteady flow and stage height in river channel networks with non-uniform bathymetry, and is demonstrated to compute networks of O(105) elements more than 330 times faster than real time on a desktop computer. The model incorporates ideas that were originally developed to address Very Large System Integration (VLSI) problems in microprocessor design, where solving large nonlinear computational problems is a common challenge. Computational speed is increased by applying Jacobian bypass techniques in a NewtoneRaphson solution and smoothing the geometric depth-area and friction-area relationships where discontinuities otherwise slow convergence. Pre-processing of junction relationships is used to remove temporal nonlinearities where river tributaries meet. Model input/output are simplified and made readily accessible to other software through use of Application Programming Interface (API) standards and a ``netlist'' idea that was previously used to describe electric circuit topology. The model is tested on both simple and complex geometry through comparisons with the HECRAS model. A example simulation is conducted for 1.5 \^A 104 river km of the Guadalupe and San Antonio river network during a 14 day rain event.},

  abstract = {Soil carbon stocks in tropical peatlands have declined recently from water table depth (WTD) drawdown caused by increased frequency and intensity of climate extremes like El Ni\~no and by artificial drainage. Restoration of these carbon stocks under these climatic and anthropogenic disturbances requires improved predictive capacity for hydrological feedbacks to ecological processes. Process-based modeling of tropical peatland ecohydrology could provide us with such capacity, but such modeling has thus far been limited. We aimed at using basic processes for water and O2 transport and their effects on ecosystem water, carbon, and nitrogen cycling to model seasonal and interannual variations of WTD and surface energy exchange. We tested these processes in a process-based model ecosys in a drained tropical Indonesian peatland from an El Ni\~no year 2002 to a wetter year 2005. WTD was modeled from hydraulically driven water transfers controlled vertically by precipitation versus evapotranspiration (ET) and laterally by discharge versus recharge to or from an external reference WTD. These transfers caused WTD drawdown and soil drying to be modeled during dry seasons, which reduced ET and increased Bowen ratio by lowering stomatal conductance. More pronounced dry seasons in drier years 2002\textendash 2004 versus wetter year 2005 caused deeper WTD, more intense peat drying, and greater plant water stress. These modeled trends were well corroborated by site measurements as apparent in regression statistics of modeled versus observed WTD (R2 {$>$} 0.8), latent heat (R2 {$>$} 0.8), and sensible heat (R2 {$>$} 0.7) fluxes. Insights gained from this modeling would aid in predicting the fate of tropical peatlands under future drier climates.},

  abstract = {Insular Southeast Asian peatlands have experienced rapid land cover changes over the past decades inducing a variety of environmental effects ranging from regional consequences on peatland ecology, biodiversity and hydrology to globally significant carbon emissions. In this paper we present the land cover and industrial plantation distribution in the peatlands of Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo in 2015 and analyse their changes since 1990. We create the 2015 maps by visual interpretation of 30 m resolution Landsat data and combine them with fully comparable and completed land cover maps of 1990 and 2007 (Miettinen and Liew, 2010). Our results reveal continued peatland deforestation and conversion into managed land cover types. In 2015, 29\% (4.6 Mha) of the peatlands in the study area remain covered by peat swamp forest (vs. 41\% or 6.4 Mha in 2007 and 76\% or 11.9 Mha in 1990). Managed land cover types (industrial plantations and smallholder dominated areas) cover 50\% (7.8 Mha) of all peatlands (vs. 33\% 5.2 Mha in 2007 and 11\% 1.7 Mha in 1990). Industrial plantations have nearly doubled their extent since 2007 (2.3 Mha; 15\%) and cover 4.3 Mha (27\%) of peatlands in 2015. The majority of these are oil palm plantations (73\%; 3.1 Mha) while nearly all of the rest (26\%; 1.1 Mha) are pulp wood plantations. We hope that the maps presented in this paper will enable improved evaluation of the magnitude of various regional to global level environmental effects of peatland conversion and that they will help decision makers to define sustainable peatland management policies for insular Southeast Asian peatlands.},

Here we describe the submodels which simulate (i) the production of plant litter, (ii) peat decomposition, and (iii) changes in peat hydraulic conductivity due to decomposition. To illustrate how the model works, DigiBog was applied to three example situations: Bogs 1, 2, and 3. For each, the net rainfall was held constant at 30 cm year 1 and the oxic decomposition parameter kept at 0\DH 015 year 1. The anoxic decomposition parameter varied from 5 \dh{} 10 6 (Bog 1) to 5 \dh{} 10 4 year 1 (Bog 3). Peatland development was simulated for 5000 years. For Bogs 1 and 2, plausible large peatland domes develop. Despite having a higher anoxic decomposition rate, Bog 2 grew thicker than Bog 1. This apparently counterintuitive result is caused by the feedback between hydraulic conductivity and degree of peat decomposition. For both Bogs 1 and 2, DigiBog also simulates transitions from wet to dry states, demarked by sudden switches from poorly decomposed to well-decomposed peat moving upwards in the peat profile. These regime shifts result from internal peatland dynamics and not from allogenic influences, and challenge the view that peat properties are always a reflection of climate. In Bog 3, a `mini-bog' developed and persisted near the margin of the peatland; this bog can also be explained in terms of the internal feedbacks within the model.

  abstract = {Generally, the diffusive wave equation, obtained by neglecting the acceleration terms in the Saint-Venant equations, is used in flood routing in rivers. Methods based on the finite-difference discretization techniques are often used to calculate discharges at each time step. A modified form of the diffusivewave equation has been developed and new resolution algorithms proposed which are better adapted to flood routing along a complex river network. The two parameters of the equation, celerity and diffusivity, can then be taken as functions of the discharge. The resolution algorithm allows the use of any distribution of lateral inflow in space and time. The accuracy of the new algorithms were compared with a traditional algorithm by numerical experimentation. Special attention was given to the instability caused by the inflow signal which constitutes the upstream boundary condition. For the fully diffusive wave flood routing problem, all three algorithms tested gave good results. The results also indicate that the efficiency of the new algorithms could be significantly improved if the position of the x-axis is modified by rotation. The new algorithms were applied to flood routing simulation over the Gardon d'Anduze catchment (542 km2) in southern France.},

Elementary graph theoretical concepts are utilized to choose the iterative flow variables so that the small units can be solved efficiently. The algorithm is computationally more efficient than the direct method using the Newton-Raphson technique by an order of magnitude. It does not involve the solution of large matrix equations. The efficiency of the algorithm is illustrated by solving an example tree-type channel network with 42 nodes, 41 channels, and a total of 429 grid points. The proposed method will also be very useful in the design and optimization of tree-type channel networks.},

As an implicit consequence of this finding, it has been assumed that there are no long-term increasing trends in nutrient exports from these peatlands after the establishment of forestry. We analysed discharge total nitrogen (TN) and phosphorus (TP) concentration data from 54 catchments with undrained pristine peatlands and 34 catchments with drained peatlands using data with considerably longer drainage history than in previous studies. Our results agree with previous studies in that discharge TN and TP concentrations in areas drained 20\textendash 30 years ago did not differ much from those in pristine sites. However, we also observed that the TN and TP concentrations were increasing with years since drainage of these catchments. Discharge TN and TP concentrations were over two times higher in areas drained 60 years ago when compared with more recently drained areas. Our results challenge the current perceptions by showing that forestry-drained peatlands may contribute to water eutrophication considerably more than previously estimated.},

  abstract = {Peat restoration is a key climate mitigation action for achieving Indonesia's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) emission reduction target. The level of carbon reduction resulting from peat restoration is uncertain, owing in part to diverse methodologies and land covers. In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted to assess the impact of rewetting on reduction of total CO2 in soil and heterotrophic emissions at the country level. The tier 2 emission factor associated with the land cover category in Indonesia was also calculated. The analysis included a total of 32 studies with 112 observations (data points) for total CO2 emissions and 31 observations for heterotrophic emissions in Indonesia. The results show that the land cover category is not a significant predictor of heterotrophic and total soil emissions, but the highest observed soil emissions were found in the plantation forest. Using the random-effects model, our results suggest that an increase in the water table depth of 10 cm would result in an increase in total CO2 emissions of 2.7 Mg CO2 ha-1 year-1 and an increase in heterotrophic emissions of 2.3 Mg CO2 ha-1 year-1. Our findings show that managing water table depth in degraded peatlands in various land cover types is important to achieve Indonesia's emission reduction target by 2030.},

The purpose of the weir construction in this area is to keep the water level of canals high and to prevent the outflow of groundwater from peatlands. The field investigation was carried out to identify the types and reasons of the damages on the weirs which were already constructed on the canal. The undisturbed peat samples carefully taken by using the thin-wall sampler were used to determine the physical parameters of the peat. The sampling rates of peat columns were more than 90 \%. The unconfined compressive strength of peat in this site was 3,2 kN/m2. The weir should be strong mechanically and hydrologically during dry and wet seasons. The weir has a spillway of which the overflow width and depth are 10 m and 0.3 m respectively. The slope of the embankment is 2:1 with wooden supports. The weir structure is divided into two zones, a water blockade zone and an erosion protection zone. The clay soil is used for the water blockade zone and the sand bags are used for the erosion protection zone. The erosion protection zone can prevent the destruction by permeation of water. Clay and sandy soils can be procured locally.},

  abstract = {Tropical peat swamp forests (PSFs) play a significant role in the exchange of water between land and the at\- mosphere. However, fire and drainage have been expanding in PSFs in recent decades. Although there is concern on the influence of fire and drainage on water circulation, their influence on evapotranspiration (ET) is insuf\- ficiently understood. Furthermore, repeated fire occurrences and their corresponding influence on the ET by recurrent burning and smoldering is unexplored. To elucidate these influences, we examined long-term variation of ET in a degraded peat swamp forest in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia that was affected by drainage and repeated fire. The continuous observation of energy fluxes was conducted for approximately 13 years between 2004 and 2016 by using the eddy covariance technique. The site burned in 2009 and 2014, and was drained in 2014. Monthly ET and net radiation (Rn) fluctuated in synchrony and thus they decreased considerably under fire-induced dense haze during the El Nin\texttildelow o drought. Troughs of ET, groundwater level (GWL) and Rn and crests of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) coincided in their time-series variations. In the case of ET {$>$} precipitation (P), ET decreased when the GWL was deeper than - 0.5 m. Half-hourly ET had a strong positive correlation with Rn (R = 0.89, p {$<$} 0.01), and partial positive relationship with VPD when VPD {$<$} 20 hPa and with GWL when GWL {$<$} -0.5 m. ET had no correlation with the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), which represents above ground biomass for the entire observation period. Alternately, the results of path analysis showed that some environmental factors controlled ET differently depending on environmental conditions. Generally, VPD negatively affected ET due to stomatal regulation functions under dry atmospheric conditions. However, the effect was negligible during the water-logged periods. This is because atmospheric dryness facilitated evaporation from exposed water on the ground surface, which canceled out the negative effect of transpiration due to stomatal closure. After drainage by canal excavation, fluctuation of GWL did not significantly influence ET, although ET decreased. This may be due to the hydrophobic dried peat soil, which prevents rainwater infiltration, disconnection of capillary force, or disabled root water uptake as GWL excessively deepened. Fire potentially decreased ET due to decreased tran\- spiration by burning of vegetation. However, the decreasing effect was cancelled by increased evaporation from the waterlogged ground surface during the subsequent La Nin\texttildelow a event. Drainage undoubtedly deepened the GWL, and ET severely decreased in cases with extremely deep GWL.},

Deforestation, drainage, fire and conversion to agricultural land threaten these ecosystems and their role in carbon sequestration. In this Review, we discuss the biogeochemistry of tropical peatlands and the impacts of ongoing anthropogenic modifications. Extensive peatlands are found in Southeast Asia, the Congo Basin and Amazonia, but their total global area remains unknown owing to inadequate data. Anthropogenic transformations result in high carbon loss and reduced carbon storage, increased greenhouse gas emissions, loss of hydrological integrity and peat subsidence accompanied by an enhanced risk of flooding. Moreover, the resulting nutrient storage and cycling changes necessitate fertilizer inputs to sustain crop production, further disturbing the ecosystem and increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Under a warming climate, these impacts are likely to intensify, with both disturbed and intact peat swamps at risk of losing 20\% of current carbon stocks by 2100. Improved measurement and observation of carbon pools and fluxes, along with process-based biogeochemical knowledge, is needed to support management strategies, protect tropical peatland carbon stocks and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.},

  abstract = {Accurate inventory of tropical peatland is important in order to (a) determine the magnitude of the carbon pool; (b) estimate the scale of transfers of peat-derived greenhouse gases to the atmosphere resulting from land use change; and (c) support carbon emissions reduction policies. We review available information on tropical peatland area and thickness and calculate peat volume and carbon content in order to determine their best estimates and ranges of variation. Our best estimate of tropical peatland area is 441 025 km2 (\$11\% of global peatland area) of which 247 778 km2 (56\%) is in Southeast Asia. We estimate the volume of tropical peat to be 1758 Gm3 (\$ 18\textendash 25\% of global peat volume) with 1359 Gm3 in Southeast Asia (77\% of all tropical peat). This new assessment reveals a larger tropical peatland carbon pool than previous estimates, with a best estimate of 88.6 Gt (range 81.7\textendash 91.9 Gt) equal to 15\textendash 19\% of the global peat carbon pool. Of this, 68.5 Gt (77\%) is in Southeast Asia, equal to 11\textendash 14\% of global peat carbon. A single country, Indonesia, has the largest share of tropical peat carbon (57.4 Gt, 65\%), followed by Malaysia (9.1 Gt, 10\%). These data are used to provide revised estimates for Indonesian and Malaysian forest soil carbon pools of 77 and 15 Gt, respectively, and total forest carbon pools (biomass plus soil) of 97 and 19 Gt. Peat carbon contributes 60\% to the total forest soil carbon pool in Malaysia and 74\% in Indonesia. These results emphasize the prominent global and regional roles played by the tropical peat carbon pool and the importance of including this pool in national and regional assessments of terrestrial carbon stocks and the prediction of peat-derived greenhouse gas emissions.},

  abstract = {Peatlands are a significant component of the global carbon (C) cycle, yet despite their role as a long-term C sink throughout the Holocene, they are increasingly vulnerable to destabilization. Nowhere is this shift from sink to source happening more rapidly than in Southeast Asia, and nowhere else are the combined pressures of land-use change and fire on peatland ecosystem C dynamics more evident nor the consequences more apparent. This review focuses on the peatlands of this region, tracing the link between deforestation and drainage and accelerating C emissions arising from peat mineralization and fire. It focuses on the implications of the recent increase in fire occurrence for air quality, human health, ecosystem resilience and the global C cycle. The scale and controls on peat-driven C emissions are addressed, noting that although fires cause large, temporary peaks in C flux to the atmosphere, year-round emissions from peat mineralization are of a similar magnitude. The review concludes by advocating land management options to reduce future fire risk as part of wider peatland management strategies, while also proposing that this region's peat fire dynamic could become increasingly relevant to northern peatlands in a warming world.

The governing equations were derived from the diffusive wave model for surface flow and the Horton infiltration model for rainfall loss. A numerical method for the diffusive wave equations was implemented based on a Godunov-type finite volume scheme. The flux at the computational cell interface was reconstructed using the piecewise linear monotonic upwind scheme for conservation laws with a van Leer slope total variation diminishing limiter. Parallelization was implemented using CUDA-Fortran with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 GPU. The proposed model was tested and verified against several 1D and 2D rainfall runoff processes with various topographies containing depressions. Simulated hydrographs, water depth, and velocity were compared to analytical solutions, dynamic wave modeling results, and measurement data. The diffusive wave model reproduced the runoff processes of impermeable basins with results similar to those of analytical solutions and the numerical results of a dynamic wave model. For ideal permeable basins containing depressions such as furrows and ponds, physically reasonable rainfall runoff processes were observed. From tests on a real basin with complex terrain, reasonable agreement with the measured data was observed. The performance of parallel computing was very efficient as the number of grids increased, achieving a maximum speedup of approximately 150 times compared to a CPU version using an Intel i7 4.7-GHz CPU in a PC environment.},

  abstract = {A significant proportion of tropical peatlands has been drained for agricultural purposes, resulting in severe degradation. Hydrological restoration, which usually involves blocking ditches, is therefore a priority. Nevertheless, the influence of ditch blocking on tropical peatland hydrological functioning is still poorly understood. We studied water-level dynamics using a combination of automated and manual dipwells, and also meteorological data during dry and wet seasons over 6 months at three locations in Sebangau National Park, Kalimantan, Indonesia. The locations were a forested peatland (Forested), a drained peatland with ditch dams (Blocked), and a drained peatland without ditch dams (Drained). In the dry season, water tables at all sites were deeper than the Indonesian regulatory requirement of 40 cm from the peat surface. In the dry season, the ditches were dry and water did not flow to them. The dry season water-table drawdown rates \textemdash{} solely due to evapotranspiration \textemdash were 9.3 mm day\`A1 at Forested, 9.6 mm day\`A1 at Blocked, but 12.7 mm day\`A1 at Drained. In the wet season, the proportion of time during which water tables in the wells were deeper than the 40 cm limit ranged between 16\% and 87\% at Forested, 0\% at Blocked, and between 0\% and 38\% at Drained. In the wet season, water flowed from the peatland to ditches at Blocked and Drained. The interquartile range of hydraulic gradients between the lowest ditch outlet and the farthest well from ditches at Blocked was 3.7 \^A 10\`A4 to 7.8 \^A 10\`A4 m m\`A1, but 1.9 \^A 10\`A3 to 2.6 \^A 10\`A3 m m\`A1 at Drained. Given the results from Forested, a water-table depth limit policy based on field data may be required, to reflect natural seasonal dynamics in tropical peatlands. Revised spatial designs of dams or bunds are also required, to ensure effective water-table management as part of tropical peatland restoration.},

  abstract = {Many tropical peatlands are subjected to artificial drainage that leads to degradation. Hence, hydrological restoration has recently been prioritized. Nevertheless, as field monitoring data are limited, little is known about how restoration measures, such as ditch dams and bunds, can regulate tropical peatland water tables. We used a hydrodynamic model \textemdash DigiBog\_Hydro\textemdash{} to simulate the effectiveness of ditch dams and bunds across three El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation (ENSO) scenarios, which are El Ni\~no, La Ni\~na and Neutral, in three typical sites. The sites were moderately degraded (Mod-Dgr) and severely degraded (Sev-Dgr) peatland plots (each 0.2 km2), representing typical peatland conditions in Sebangau National Park, Kalimantan, Indonesia. Our fine-scale (1 m \^A 1 m spatial resolution) modelling revealed that in the dry season of any ENSO scenario, the significant effects of ditch-dams alone on peatland water-level were limited to lateral distances of 26 m (in Mod-Dgr) and 12 m (in Sev-Dgr) from the ditch. In the dry season of an El Ni\~no year, the combination of ditch dams and bunds helped maintain water levels up to 72 cm (in Mod-Dgr) and 69 cm (in Sev-Dgr) higher than in the no-restoration condition. During the extremedry period of an El Ni\~no year, the bunds reduced the number of days when the water table was deeper than 40 cm in Mod-Dgr and in Sev-Dgr by 50\% and 73\%, respectively. We suggest that bunds used in combination with ditch dams are a practical restoration measure for tropical peatlands, providing critical extra water storage and helping maintain water tables near the peatland surface in dry periods. We also demonstrate how fine-scale hydrodynamic modelling is beneficial for planning and assessment of restoration measures in tropical peatlands.},

The construction of thousands of kilometres of canals resulted in over-drainage and targets for agricultural production failed. Abandoned, the area has been subject to severe forest and peat fires. Restoration of degraded peatlands normally starts with restoring the water table to rewet the surface in order to control fire and to initiate reforestation. Canal blocking strategies are a potential means for accomplishing this. In a test plot in the Northern part of Block C of the former Mega Rice Project (MRP), a series of dams were constructed and (ground)water tables and subsidence rates were monitored to assess the effects of dam construction on peatland hydrology. The resulting higher water tables did not completely compensate for the negative effects of increased subsidence near the canals. The canals, which are ``eating'' themselves into the peatland, create depressions in the peatland surface leading to interception of overland- and interflow and increased risk of overtopping of dams during extreme rainfall events. The lessons learned are being used to improve blocking strategies and dam design. The changes in peatland topography caused by drainage, however, need to be better understood in order to further refine strategies for hydrological restoration of degraded peatlands in Indonesia.},

The design principles for the drainage systems currently being implemented on peatlands are the same as for mineral soils. The objective of such systems is the timely removal of excess rainfall by surface runoff. For peatlands, with their different soil-hydraulic characteristics, these systems have resulted in poor watertable control and high rates of irreversible subsidence. Concerns about this rate of subsidence and the level of sustainability of the present land use have prompted a study to develop a new water management system. This new system includes a shift from a drainage system that focuses on discharge of excess water towards a system that combines drainage and water conservation. In the new two-step design, the drain spacing and corresponding drain discharges are obtained with a steady-state approach. These outputs are used to calculate the capacity of the drains, including control structures, using an unsteady-state approach. The new system results in a shallower but more narrowly spaced drainage system and maintains a more constant but relatively high watertable and reduces subsidence. It should be remembered however, that even with the improved water management, subsidence cannot be arrested; it is the price one has to pay for the use of tropical peatlands.},

Therefore, we measured water table dynamics, CO2 fluxes, and soil properties at four sloping fens that were restored (1\textendash 20 years post-restoration) with the installation of small check dams in ditches that had drained the sites for a century. Restoration had a positive effect on water tables, increasing from approximately 45 cm below the surface to approximately 15 cm below the surface during the summers. Restoration also benefited CO2 fluxes, as the mean net ecosystem exchange was greatest in the restored areas (-2.19 g CO2 m-2 hour-1) compared to the unrestored drained areas (-1.28 g CO2 m-2 hour-1), while in reference areas it was -1.74 g CO2 m-2 hour-1. Drainage also caused significant changes to the peat soil including: 25\% reduction in soil organic matter (lost between 1.4 to 3.6 kg/m2), increased bulk density, decreased porosity, and reduced saturated hydraulic conductivity. Restoration did not affect these parameters, even 20 years after restoration. This study suggests that although natural water table levels have been reestablished and the process of carbon sequestration improved, the physical properties of the most disturbed, near surface peat soils do not mimic reference conditions 20 years post-restoration.},

One-year long climate scenarios were run, each representing a typical year in the present and future (2020 s and 2050 s), by perturbing the historical weather according to the downscaled Canadian Coupled Global Model 1 (CGCM1) general circulation model results. CGCM1 downscaling was used to predict basin-scale runoff for the Kettle River upstream of Grand Forks. These results were converted to river discharge along the Kettle and Granby River reaches. Future climate scenarios indicate a shift in river peak flow to an earlier date in a year; the shift for the 2040\textendash 2069 climate is larger than for the 2010\textendash 2039, although the overall hydrograph shape remains the same. Aquifer water levels shift by the same interval, when compared on the same day of the year. Distal from the river, modeled water level differences are less than 0.5 m, but were found to be greater than 0.5 m near the river. The maximum groundwater levels associated with the peak hydrograph are very similar to present climate because the peak discharge is not predicted to change, only the timing of the peak.},

Here, we review the current state of ISSHM testing and evaluate the most popular ISSHM test cases by comparing the hydrodynamic processes simulated in each case to the processes found in well-characterized, real-world catchments and by comparing their general attributes to those of successful benchmark problems from other fields of hydrogeology. The review reveals that (1) ISSHM testing and intercode comparison have not adopted specific test cases consistently; (2) despite the wide range of ISSHM metrics available for model testing, only two model performance diagnostics are typically adopted: the catchment outflow hydrograph and the catchment water balance; (3) in intercode comparisons, model performance is usually judged by evaluating only one performance diagnostic: the catchment outflow hydrograph; and (4) ISSHM test cases evaluate a small number of hydrodynamic processes that are largely uniform across the model domain, representing a limited selection of the processes of interest in well-characterized, real-world catchments. ISSHM testing would benefit from more intercode comparisons using a consistent set of test cases, aimed at evaluating more catchment processes (e.g. flooding) and using a wider range of simulation diagnostics (e.g. pressure head distributions). To achieve this, a suite of test case variations is required to capture the relevant catchment processes. Finally, there is a need for additional ISSHM test problems that compare model predictions with hydrological observations from intensively monitored field sites and controlled laboratory experiments.

  abstract = {Over recent decades, the combination of deforestation, peat drainage and fires have resulted in widespread degradation of Southeast Asia's tropical peatlands. These disturbances are generally thought to increase peat soil bulk density through peat drying and shrinkage, compaction, and consolidation. Biological oxidation and fires burning across these landscapes also consume surface peat, exposing older peat strata. The prevalence and severity of deforestation, peat drainage and fire are typically greater closer to canals, built to drain peatlands and provide access routes for people. We compared bulk densities of 240cm peat profiles from intact forests and degraded peatlands broadly, and also assessed differences between degraded peatlands near-to-canals (50\textendash 200m from the nearest canal) and far-from-canals (300+ m from the nearest canal). The effects of vegetation type and fire frequency on bulk density, irrespective of the distance from canal, were also investigated. Mean bulk density values ranged between 0.08 and 0.16gcm-3 throughout the 240cm peat profiles. Drainage of peat near-to-canals increased bulk density of peat above the minimum water table depth. Degradation by deforestation and fire also increased bulk densities of upper peat strata, albeit with greater variability. Peat sampled further from canals experienced less intense water table drawdowns, buffering them from drainage effects. These areas were also more commonly forested and burnt less frequently. Differences in bulk densities below minimum water table levels are less clear, but may reflect lowering of the current peat surface in degraded peatlands broadly. These results clearly show that important differences in bulk density exist across degraded peatlands that are spatially dependent on distance from canals and disturbance history. These landscape features should be taken into account when designing future bulk density sampling efforts and peatland restoration programs, or when extrapolating from existing sources in order to make accurate inferences from them.},

Site productivity depends both on natural factors inherent to the site and on management-related factors. This review of the evolution of site assessment highlights three tenets of forest site productivity: the height\textendash age site index, Eichhorn's rule and the thinning response hypothesis. These tenets rely on the hypotheses that height growth correlates well with stand volume growth, that total volume production of a given tree species at a given stand height should be identical for all site classes and that stand volume growth is independent of thinning practice for a wide range of thinning grades. The maturation of long-term field experiments has provided for the revision of these hypotheses, and contributed to an understanding of situations where they do not hold. This led to the introduction of the concept of yield level, the stand volume growth per unit of height growth. The use of the yield level theory for estimating site productivity has facilitated the development of a three-dimensional model of the relationship between stem number, quadratic mean diameter and stand basal area. Given this model, a stand density index based on the combination of stem number and quadratic mean diameter provides an indication of the yield level, which may be used to adjust height-age\textendash based estimates of site productivity.},

Surface-water and groundwater ecosystems are viewed as linked components of a hydrologic continuum leading to related sustainability issues. This overview concludes with a discussion of research needs and challenges facing this evolving field. The biogeochemical processes within the upper few centimeters of sediments beneath nearly all surface-water bodies (hyporheic zone) have a profound effect on the chemistry of the water interchange, and here is where most of the recent research has been focusing. However, to advance conceptual and other modeling of GW\textendash SW systems, a broader perspective of such interactions across and between surfacewater bodies is needed, including multidimensional analyses, interface hydraulic characterization and spatial variability, site-to-region regionalization approaches, as well as cross-disciplinary collaborations.},

A semi-implicit scheme is used for the discretisation of the surface water flow equations and a fully implicit scheme for the discretisation of the groundwater flow equations. The two sets of equations are coupled at the common interface of the surface water and groundwater bodies, where water exchange takes place, using Darcy's law. A new approach is proposed for the solution of the coupled surface water and groundwater equations in a simultaneous manner, in such a fashion that gives computational efficiency at low computational cost. IRENE is verified against three analytical solutions of surface water\textendash groundwater interaction, which are chosen so that different components of the model can be tested.

The Rewetting program that aims to rehabilitate hydrologically a peatland to a near natural state is carried out by canal blocking, canal backfilling, and construction of deep wells. To know the progress of the restoration activities by BRG, it is very important to understand the effectiveness of canal blocking on rewetting of the tropical peatland. The effectiveness of canal blocking was investigated through the monitoring of groundwater level (GWL) fluctuation around the canal block. This study was carried out at a canal block that is located at the peatland of Sungai Tohor Village, Kepulauan Meranti Regency, Riau Province. For monitoring of GWL fluctuation as the impact of canal blocking, five dipwells were set at the peatland that are perpendicular to the canal with the distance of 20 m, 70 m, 120 m, 170 m, and 220 m respectively. The results of this study show that the impact of canal blocking could raise the water table in the peatland at the radius of about 170 m from the canal. The radius impact of the rewetting might be bigger or smaller, that strongly depends on the hydrotopography situation of the area.},

  abstract = {Water management is an important aspect of hydrological restoration and fire prevention in tropical peatland because the availability of water is not well distributed in the dry and rainy seasons. The degraded peatlands with massive canalization are very vulnerable against peat fire especially in the dry season. A pilot project for water management was conducted at Tanjung Leban, Bengkalis Regency, Riau Province with the purpose not only for hydrological restoration but also for fire prevention. In 2013, 2014, and 2015, the big peat fires occurred at Tanjung Leban and many peatland areas in Riau which caused a haze disaster. Peatland restoration and peat fire prevention efforts have been continuously undertaken by Peatland Restoration Agency and stakeholders at Tanjung Leban and many peatland areas in Riau. The rewetting, revegetation, and revitalization of livelihood were the integrated approaches that were carried out to support the peatland restoration. The aim of this research is to monitor the hydrological condition as the impact of rewetting activities using canal blocking at Tanjung Leban. Forty dip wells in four transects and an automatic rainfall record equipment were set up in the research area to monitor the groundwater level (GWL) and the rainfall event as the impact of rewetting activities. The result shows that the rewetting activity using canal blocking has a significant impact on the rewetting effort so that the risk of peat fire can be minimized. The historical evidence shows that the peatland restoration has been improving after the peatland areas were kept in always wet conditions.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The Amazon plays a critical role in global atmospheric budgets of methane~(CH4) and nitrous oxide~(N2O). However, while we have a relatively good understanding of the continental-scale flux of these greenhouse gases~(GHGs), one of the key gaps in knowledge is the specific contribution of peatland ecosystems to the regional budgets of these GHGs. Here we report CH4 and N2O fluxes from lowland tropical peatlands in the Pastaza\textendash Mara\~n\'on foreland basin~(PMFB) in Peru, one of the largest peatland complexes in the Amazon basin. The goal of this research was to quantify the range and magnitude of CH4 and N2O fluxes from this region, assess seasonal trends in trace gas exchange, and determine the role of different environmental variables in driving GHG flux. Trace gas fluxes were determined from the most numerically dominant peatland vegetation types in the region: forested vegetation, forested (short pole) vegetation, Mauritia flexuosa-dominated palm swamp, and mixed palm swamp. Data were collected in both wet and dry seasons over the course of four field campaigns from~2012 to~2014. Diffusive CH4 emissions averaged 36.05\,{$\pm$}\,3.09\,mg\,CH4\textendash C\,m-2\,day-1 across the entire dataset, with diffusive CH4 flux varying significantly among vegetation types and between seasons. Net ebullition of CH4 averaged 973.3\,{$\pm$}\,161.4\,mg\,CH4\textendash C\,m-2\,day-1 and did not vary significantly among vegetation types or between seasons. Diffusive CH4 flux was greatest for mixed palm swamp (52.0\,{$\pm$}\,16.0\,mg\,CH4\textendash C\,m-2\,day-1), followed by M.~flexuosa palm swamp (36.7\,{$\pm$}\,3.9\,mg\,CH4\textendash C\,m-2\,day-1), forested (short pole) vegetation (31.6\,{$\pm$}\,6.6\,mg\,CH4\textendash C\,m-2\,day-1), and forested vegetation (29.8\,{$\pm$}\,10.0\,mg\,CH4\textendash C\,m-2\,day-1). Diffusive CH4 flux also showed marked seasonality, with divergent seasonal patterns among ecosystems. Forested vegetation and mixed palm swamp showed significantly higher dry season (47.2\,{$\pm$}\,5.4\,mg\,CH4\textendash C\,m-2\,day-1 and 85.5\,{$\pm$}\,26.4\,mg\,CH4\textendash C\,m-2\,day-1, respectively) compared to wet season emissions (6.8\,{$\pm$}\,1.0\,mg\,CH4\textendash C\,m-2\,day-1 and 5.2\,{$\pm$}\,2.7\,mg\,CH4\textendash C\,m-2\,day-1, respectively). In contrast, forested (short pole) vegetation and M.~flexuosa palm swamp showed the opposite trend, with dry season flux of 9.6\,{$\pm$}\,2.6 and 25.5\,{$\pm$}\,2.9\,mg\,CH4\textendash C\,m-2\,day-1, respectively, versus wet season flux of 103.4\,{$\pm$}\,13.6 and 53.4\,{$\pm$}\,9.8\,mg\,CH4\textendash C\,m-2\,day-1, respectively. These divergent seasonal trends may be linked to very high water tables ({$>$}\,1\,m) in forested vegetation and mixed palm swamp during the wet season, which may have constrained CH4 transport across the soil\textendash atmosphere interface. Diffusive N2O flux was very low (0.70\,{$\pm$}\,0.34\,\textmu g\,N2O\textendash N\,m-2\,day-1) and did not vary significantly among ecosystems or between seasons. We conclude that peatlands in the PMFB are large and regionally significant sources of atmospheric CH4 that need to be better accounted for in regional emissions inventories. In contrast, N2O flux was negligible, suggesting that this region does not make a significant contribution to regional atmospheric budgets of N2O. The divergent seasonal pattern in CH4 flux among vegetation types challenges our underlying assumptions of the controls on CH4 flux in tropical peatlands and emphasizes the need for more process-based measurements during periods of high water table.},

  abstract = {Drained peatlands are one of the main sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions globally. Emission reduction and, more generally, ecosystem restoration can be enhanced by raising the water table using canal or drain blocks. When restoring large areas, the number of blocks becomes limited by the available resources, which raises the following question: in which exact positions should a given number of blocks be placed in order to maximize the water table rise throughout the area? There is neither a simple nor an analytic answer. The water table response is a complex phenomenon that depends on several factors, such as the topology of the canal network, site topography, peat hydraulic properties, vegetation characteristics and meteorological conditions. We developed a new method to position the canal blocks based on the combination of a hydrological model and heuristic optimization algorithms. We simulated 3 d dry downs from a water saturated initial state for different block positions using the Boussinesq equation, and the block configurations maximizing water table rise were searched for by means of genetic algorithm and simulated annealing. We applied this approach to a large drained peatland area (931 km2) in Sumatra, Indonesia. Our solution consistently outperformed traditional block locating methods, indicating that drained peatland restoration can be made more effective at the same cost by selecting the positions of the blocks using the presented scheme.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Reduction of carbon emissions from peatlands is recognized as an important factor in global climate change mitigation. Within the SE Asia region, areas of deeper peat present the greatest carbon stocks, and therefore the greatest potential for future carbon emissions from degradation and fire. They also support most of the remaining lowland swamp forest and its associated biodiversity. Accurate maps of deep peat are central to providing correct estimates of peat carbon stocks and to facilitating appropriate management interventions. We present a rapid and cost-effective approach to peat thickness mapping in raised peat bogs that applies a model of peat bottom elevation based on field measurements subtracted from a surface elevation model created from airborne LiDAR data. Results:\hspace{0.6em} In two raised peat bog test areas in Indonesia, we find that field peat thickness measurements correlate well with surface elevation derived from airborne LiDAR based DTMs \-(R2 0.83\textendash 0.88), confirming that the peat bottom is often relatively flat. On this basis, we created a map of extent and depth of deep peat ({$>$}\,3 m) from a new DTM that covers two-thirds of Sumatran peatlands, applying a flat peat bottom of 0.61 m +MSL determined from the average of 2446 field measurements. A deep peat area coverage of 2.6 Mha or 60.1\% of the total peat area in eastern Sumatra is mapped, suggesting that deep peat in this region is more common than shallow peat and its extent was underestimated in earlier maps. The associated deep peat carbon stock range is 9.0\textendash 11.5 Pg C in eastern Sumatra alone. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} We discuss how the deep peat map may be used to identify priority areas for peat and forest conservation and thereby help prevent major potential future carbon emissions and support the safeguarding of the remaining forest and biodiversity. We propose rapid application of this method to other coastal raised bog peatland areas in SE Asia in support of improved peatland zoning and management. We demonstrate that the upcoming global ICESat-2 and GEDI satellite LiDAR coverage will likely result in a global DTM that, within a few years, will be sufficiently accurate for this application.},

  abstract = {The spatial and temporal patterns of rainfall over the Baram River Basin (BR) in Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo) were characterised through cluster analysis and multivariate statistics for the 25~year period from 1990 to 2014. Baram River Basin recorded an average annual rainfall of 3654~mm with high spatial and temporal variations. Ward's method based analytical hieratical clustering (AHC) identified three homogeneous clusters (HC's) of rain gauging stations (HC-I, HC-II, and HC-III). Rain gauges in HC-I are located in high rainfall domain, HC-II gauges are in moderate rainfall domain and HC-III gauges are in low rainfall domains. The moderate elevation regions in the Baram basin recorded the highest amounts of rainfall compared to lower and upper elevated regions. Multivariate statistics show variation in the distribution of monthly and annual rainfall within and between individual HC's. Mean annual rainfall recorded at individual HC's varies by around 1000~mm. Though the mean monthly rainfall distribution in HC's varies by more than 70~mm, all clusters show a common pattern of high and low rainfall seasons related to monsoon characteristics of the region. The northeast monsoon (NEM) is the wettest period with highest mean rainfall falling in the months of November and December at all stations. In comparison, the southwest monsoon (SWM) is the driest season with the lowest mean rainfall falling in July. It was also noted that the inter-monsoon periods are actually wetter than the SWM season. Overall, rainfall in the Baram shows high inter-annual variability with dominant low rainfall domain in the lower (coastal) and upper (plateau) reach with highly localised high rainfall domain surrounded by fluctuating moderate rainfall areas in the middle reaches of the river basin. The localised nature of high rainfall domain in the central (south and southwest) part of the basin suggests that the surrounding elevated mountains and hills in that region influence the high rainfall recorded. The findings of the present research will aid in formulating water resource management plans, large scale plantation and agricultural practices and any other hydrological development projects in the region.}

Model simulations indicate that warming accelerates peat SOC loss, while increasing precipitation accelerates peat SOC accumulation at millennial time scales.

Peatland ecosystems show a higher vulnerability than nonpeatland ecosystems, as indicated by the ratio of their soil carbon density changes (ranging from 3.9 to 5.8). This is primarily due to larger peatlands carbon stocks and more dramatic responses of their aerobic and anaerobic decompositions in comparison with nonpeatland ecosystems under future climate conditions. Peatland and nonpeatland soils in the PMFB may lose up to 0.4 (0.32\textendash 0.52) Pg{$\cdot$}C by AD 2100 with the largest loss from palm swamp.

Gleam combines a wide range of remotely sensed observations to estimate the terrestrial evaporation and root-zone soil moisture at a global scale (0.25-degree). The aim is to assess the accuracy of Gleam data by examining correlation, mean absolute error, Root means square error and mean error between Epan and Gleam data in Java and Bali Island. The result shows the correlation between Epan with Ep Gleam is higher than Epan with E Gleam. Generally, the accuracy of Gleam data is a good performance to estimate the land evaporation in Java and Bali at annual and monthly scale. In daily scale, the correlation is less than 0.50 both between Epan with E Gleam and between Epan with Ep Gleam. In a daily scale, the average errors ranging from 0.15 to 3.09 mm according to RMSE, MAE, and ME. The result of this study is essential in providing a valuable recommendation for choosing alternative evaporation data in a regional or local scale from satellite data.},

  abstract = {Tropical peat swamp forest is a unique ecosystem, in which both swamp forest and peat soil have coexisted over millennia and accumulated a significant amount of soil carbon as peat. Owing to the huge soil carbon stock and high groundwater level (GWL), tropical peatlands potentially represent a significant source of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. However, a few studies of CH4 flux by the soil chamber technique have reported that annual CH4 emissions from tropical peat swamp forest were very low as compared to mid- and high-latitude peatlands. Recently, it has been reported that some tree species growing in peat swamp forest emit CH4 from their stems. It is impossible to continuously measure ecosystem-scale CH4 flux including both soil and plant-mediated CH4 emissions by the chamber technique. Thus, we have measured net ecosystem CH4 exchange (FCH4) above a tropical peat swamp forest in Sarawak, Malaysia using the eddy covariance technique from February 2014 to July 2015 (18 months). The mean ( {$\pm$} 1 standard deviation) of half-hourly measured FCH4 was 24.0 {$\pm$} 42.2 nmol m\textendash 2 s\textendash 1. Monthly mean FCH4 was always positive during the 18 months, even in the driest month with mean GWL of \textendash 30 cm. FCH4 was positively associated with GWL or soil moisture in a quadratic form. Annual FCH4 from March 2014 through February 2015 was 7.5\textendash 10.8 g C m\textendash 2 yr\textendash 1. The annual FCH4 was much higher than annual soil CH4 emissions from tropical peatlands, because the FCH4 included aboveground CH4 emissions mainly from tree stems. However, the annual FCH4 was relatively low in comparison with those measured by the eddy covariance technique in mid- and high-latitude peatlands.},

The hydrological model SIMGRO was used to calculate the effects of drainage on peat water levels, peat surface morphology and river flows within the Air Hitam Laut catchment in Jambi Province, Sumatra, Indonesia. Model outcomes were calibrated and validated using groundwater levels monitored at several sites, discharges measured in the Air Hitam Laut River and flooding patterns derived from remotely sensed Radar images. The validated model was used to predict consequences of three possible scenarios: (i) expansion of oil palm plantations upstream, (ii) expansion of agriculture downstream and (iii) continuing fire damage. Oil palm plantation development results in changes to the drainage pattern of the catchment and reduces its natural extent. Lowered river discharge will have a detrimental affect upon the sustainability of Berbak National Park in the centre of the catchment and reduce prospects for agriculture and fisheries in the coastal zone. Expansion of agriculture downstream causes peat subsidence, resulting in exposure of underlying, acid sulphate soils and intrusion of saline sea water. Continuing fires will increase considerably the area of permanently flooded land and thus constrain peatland restoration options. For peatland restoration to be successful hydrological management must be accompanied by economic measures to improve the livelihoods of local people and by effective law enforcement.},

Although considered sensitive to climate change and anthropogenic pressures, the spatial extent of peatlands is poorly constrained. We report the development of an improved global peatland map, PEATMAP, based on a meta-analysis of geospatial information collated from a variety of sources at global, regional and national levels. We estimate total global peatland area to be 4.23 million km2, approximately 2.84\% of the world land area. Our results suggest that previous global peatland inventories are likely to underestimate peat extent in the tropics, and to overestimate it in parts of mid- and high-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Global wetland and soil datasets are poorly suited to estimating peatland distribution. For instance, tropical peatland extents are overestimated by Global Lakes and Wetlands Database \textendash{} Level 3 (GLWD-3) due to the lack of ground-truthing data; and underestimated by the use of histosols to represent peatlands in the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) v1.2, as large areas of swamp forest peat in the humid tropics are omitted. PEATMAP and its underlying data are freely available as a potentially useful tool for scientists and policy makers with interests in peatlands or wetlands. PEATMAP's data format and file structure are intended to allow it to be readily updated when previously undocumented peatlands are found and mapped, and when regional or national land cover maps are updated and refined.},

The method treats backwater effects at the junction points on the basis of junction-point water stage prediction and correction (JPWSPC). It is applicable to flows in both looped and nonlooped channel networks and has no requirement on the flow directions. The method is implemented in a numerical model, in which the Saint-Venant equations are discretized by using the four-point implicit Preissmann scheme, and the resulting nonlinear system of equations is solved by using the Newton-Raphson method. With the help of JPWSPC, each branch is computed independently. This guarantees the simplicity, efficiency, and robustness of the numerical model. The model is applied to two hypothetic channel networks and a real-life river network in South China. All the networks contain both branched and looped structures.

However, the net-exchange dependence on hydrothermal conditions and wetland integrity remains unclear. Using a global-scale in situ database on net greenhouse gas exchanges, we show diverse hydrology-influenced emission patterns in CO2, CH4 and N2O. We find that total CO2-equivalent emissions from wetlands are kept to a minimum when the water table is near the surface. By contrast, greenhouse gas exchange rates peak in flooded and drained conditions. By extrapolating the current trajectory of degradation, we estimate that between 2021 and 2100, wetlands could result in greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to around 408 gigatons of CO2. However, rewetting wetlands could reduce these emissions such that the radiative forcing caused by CH4 and N2O is fully compensated by CO2 uptake. As wetland greenhouse gas budgets are highly sensitive to changes in wetland area, the resulting impact on climate from wetlands will depend on the balance between future degradation and restoration.}
