	abstract = {This paper examines the dynamics of a networked, multi-agent system operating with an advection-based coordination algorithm. Flow advection is a close relative of diffusion whose discretized version forms the basis of the popular consensus dynamics. We endeavor to demonstrate in this paper that discretizing the continuous advection equation also forms an attractive set of system dynamics for coordinated control. The key advantage of advection-based algorithms over directed consensus is that the sum of the states is always conserved. This paper includes a formulation of the advection dynamics on directed graphs and a presentation of some of its characteristics, which are compared to the consensus dynamics. We also provide examples of the versatility of the advection dynamics: a formation control and sensor coverage example.},

	abstract = {Peatlands cover many low-lying areas in the tropics. Tropical peatlands are intriguing systems because of their tight coupling between hydrology and carbon storage: They accumulate carbon over thousands of years because of waterlogging, and they remain waterlogged after growing into domed shapes because peat restricts drainage. This feedback between waterlogging and landscape morphology generates landforms with special hydrologic properties that enable simplifications of standard watershed models. In natural tropical peatlands, the water table is always near the surface and infiltration is almost immediate. In addition, water table fluctuations relative to the peat surface are remarkably uniform across tropical peatlands because these peatlands acquire shapes with a uniform topographic wetness index. In this paper, we show that because of these distinctive properties, simple hydrologic models that represent the hydraulic state of a catchment by a scalar quantity that describes total water storage are useful and physically meaningful in tropical peatlands. We demonstrate how to efficiently derive hillslope-scale parameterizations of transmissivity and specific yield as functions of water table height for a tropical peatland from water table, rainfall, and topographic data. Our findings suggest that natural tropical peatland subcatchments could be usefully modeled as single hydrologic response units for river flow and flood forecasting.},

	abstract = {In Southeast Asia, peatland is widely distributed and has accumulated a massive amount of soil carbon, coexisting with peat swamp forest ({PSF}). The peatland, however, has been rapidly degraded by deforestation, ﬁres, and drainage for the last two decades. Such disturbances change hydrological conditions, typically groundwater level ({GWL}), and accelerate oxidative peat decomposition. Evapotranspiration ({ET}) is a major determinant of {GWL}, whereas information on the {ET} of {PSF} is limited. Therefore, we measured {ET} using the eddy covariance technique for 4–6 years between 2002 and 2009, including El Nin{\textasciitilde}o and La Nin{\textasciitilde}a events, at three sites in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. The sites were different in disturbance degree: a {PSF} with little drainage ({UF}), a heavily drained {PSF} ({DF}), and a drained burnt ex-{PSF} ({DB}); {GWL} was signiﬁcantly lowered at {DF}, especially in the dry season. The {ET} showed a clear seasonal variation with a peak in the mid-dry season and a large decrease in the late dry season, mainly following seasonal variation in net radiation (Rn). The Rn drastically decreased with dense smoke from peat ﬁres in the late dry season. Annual {ET} forced to close energy balance for 4 years was 1636 Æ 53, 1553 Æ 117, and 1374 Æ 75 mm {yrÀ}1 (mean Æ 1 standard deviation), respectively, at {UF}, {DF}, and {DB}. The undrained {PSF} ({UF}) had high and rather stable annual {ET}, independently of El Nin{\textasciitilde}o and La Nin{\textasciitilde}a events, in comparison with other tropical rainforests. The minimum monthly-mean {GWL} explained 80\% of interannual variation in {ET} for the forest sites ({UF} and {DF}); the positive relationship between {ET} and {GWL} indicates that drainage by a canal decreased {ET} at {DF} through lowering {GWL}. In addition, {ET} was decreased by 16\% at {DB} in comparison with {UF} chieﬂy because of vegetation loss through ﬁres.},

The Global Summary of the Day rainfall records provide 26 years of rainfall data (January 1985 to August 2010) for 23 stations throughout the Indonesian islands. The {ENSO} and {SST} variations were calculated using the Multivariate {ENSO} Index ({MEI}), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation ({PDO}), {NINO}1 + 2, {NINO}3, {NINO}3.4, {NINO}4, the Dipole Mode Index ({DMI}) for the Indian Ocean Dipole ({IOD}), and Indian Ocean Basin-wide ({IOBW}) index. The results show that the rainfall in the southern Sumatra and southern Java Islands, which face the Indian Ocean, was positively correlated with the negative {IOD}, whereas the rainfall in northwestern Sumatra was positively correlated with the positive {IOD}. In eastern Indonesia, the rainfall was positively correlated with La Niña. The {PDO} index was also strongly correlated with the rainfall in this region. In central Indonesia, seasonal variations due to monsoons are predominant, and the rainfall exhibited strong negative and positive correlations with the {MEI} and {NINO}.{WEST}, respectively, indicating that high rainfall occurred during strong La Niña episodes. The highly negative and positive correlations with the {MEI} and {NINO}.{WEST}, respectively, in central Indonesia led us to analyze the impacts of Indonesian seas on the rainfall in the region. Using four synoptic-scale scenarios, we investigated the relative residence time of Indonesian seawater along the pathways associated with the Pacific-Indian hydraulic head difference. The results show that when both the western Pacific and eastern Indian Oceans are warm (positive {NINO}.{WEST} and negative {DMI}), the rainfall intensity over central Indonesia is strongest.},

	abstract = {Drained peatlands are one of the main sources of carbon dioxide ({CO}2) emissions globally. Emission reduction and, more generally, ecosystem restoration can be enhanced by raising the water table using canal or drain blocks. When restoring large areas, the number of blocks becomes limited by the available resources, which raises the following question: in which exact positions should a given number of blocks be placed in order to maximize the water table rise throughout the area? There is neither a simple nor an analytic answer. The water table response is a complex phenomenon that depends on several factors, such as the topology of the canal network, site topography, peat hydraulic properties, vegetation characteristics and meteorological conditions. We developed a new method to position the canal blocks based on the combination of a hydrological model and heuristic optimization algorithms. We simulated 3 d dry downs from a water saturated initial state for different block positions using the Boussinesq equation, and the block conﬁgurations maximizing water table rise were searched for by means of genetic algorithm and simulated annealing. We applied this approach to a large drained peatland area (931 km2) in Sumatra, Indonesia. Our solution consistently outperformed traditional block locating methods, indicating that drained peatland restoration can be made more effective at the same cost by selecting the positions of the blocks using the presented scheme.},

However, for digital elevation data derived networks to be useful they have to be extracted at the correct length scale or drainage density. Here we suggest a criterion for determining the appropriate drainage density at which to extract networks from digital elevation data. The criterion is basically to extract the highest resolution (highest drainage density) network that satisfies scaling laws that have traditionally been found to hold for channel networks. Procedures that use this criterion are presented and tested on 21 digital elevation data sets well distributed throughout the U S .},

One-year long climate scenarios were run, each representing a typical year in the present and future (2020 s and 2050 s), by perturbing the historical weather according to the downscaled Canadian Coupled Global Model 1 ({CGCM}1) general circulation model results. {CGCM}1 downscaling was used to predict basin-scale runoff for the Kettle River upstream of Grand Forks. These results were converted to river discharge along the Kettle and Granby River reaches. Future climate scenarios indicate a shift in river peak ﬂow to an earlier date in a year; the shift for the 2040–2069 climate is larger than for the 2010–2039, although the overall hydrograph shape remains the same. Aquifer water levels shift by the same interval, when compared on the same day of the year. Distal from the river, modeled water level differences are less than 0.5 m, but were found to be greater than 0.5 m near the river. The maximum groundwater levels associated with the peak hydrograph are very similar to present climate because the peak discharge is not predicted to change, only the timing of the peak.},

	abstract = {The interactions between groundwater and surface water are complex. To understand these interactions in relation to climate, landform, geology, and biotic factors, a sound hydrogeoecological framework is needed. All these aspects are synthesized and exemplified in this overview. In addition, the mechanisms of interactions between groundwater and surface water ({GW}–{SW}) as they affect recharge–discharge processes are comprehensively outlined, and the ecological significance and the human impacts of such interactions are emphasized. Surface-water and groundwater ecosystems are viewed as linked components of a hydrologic continuum leading to related sustainability issues. This overview concludes with a discussion of research needs and challenges facing this evolving field. The biogeochemical processes within the upper few centimeters of sediments beneath nearly all surface-water bodies (hyporheic zone) have a profound effect on the chemistry of the water interchange, and here is where most of the recent research has been focusing. However, to advance conceptual and other modeling of {GW}–{SW} systems, a broader perspective of such interactions across and between surfacewater bodies is needed, including multidimensional analyses, interface hydraulic characterization and spatial variability, site-to-region regionalization approaches, as well as cross-disciplinary collaborations.},

	abstract = {Scientists and practitioners agree that integrated water resource management is necessary, with an increasing need for research at the regional scale (103 to 105 km2). At this scale interactions between environmental and human systems are fully developed and global change is linked to local actions. The groundwater-surface water interaction ({GW}-{SW}) is of particular interest. Herein we review the scientific journal literature and examine {GW}-{SW} at the regional scale. We briefly review all existing literature on {GW}-{SW}, then summarise its characteristics at different scales and identify specific challenges of the regional scale. We explore whether {GW}-{SW} should be treated differently at regional and local scales. Regional {GW}-{SW} is rarely examined in experimental field studies, which almost exclusively cover small areas. However, {GW}-{SW} is often integral to large scale coupled models. Thus, we collate information about existing models and their regional applications. Fully coupled, physics-based models have great potential to meet the technical challenges. However, limited data availability hampers the application of complex models at the regional scale and loosely coupled schemes are more widely applied. Many integrated modelling concepts have been published, but none have been applied in a wide range of settings. Thus, it is impossible to compare the performance of different approaches. Comparative analyses of existing regional scale integrated models in the context of different data availability and geographic conditions are needed. Unfortunately, peer-reviewed journal literature no longer provides a representative picture of the subject as models are becoming Btoo big to be published{\textasciicircum} or too pragmatic.},

The method treats backwater effects at the junction points on the basis of junction-point water stage prediction and correction ({JPWSPC}). It is applicable to flows in both looped and nonlooped channel networks and has no requirement on the flow directions. The method is implemented in a numerical model, in which the Saint-Venant equations are discretized by using the four-point implicit Preissmann scheme, and the resulting nonlinear system of equations is solved by using the Newton-Raphson method. With the help of {JPWSPC}, each branch is computed independently. This guarantees the simplicity, efficiency, and robustness of the numerical model. The model is applied to two hypothetic channel networks and a real-life river network in South China. All the networks contain both branched and looped structures. The simulated results compare well with the results from literature or the measurements. {DOI}: 10.1061/({ASCE}){HY} .1943-7900.0000356. © 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {We developed and applied a computational model for simulating unsteady flow in a drainage network of a boreal forested peatland site. The input to the model was the hourly runoff produced by a hydrological model. The simulations of the flow in the ditch network were performed using an iterative procedure for solving the Saint-Venant equations that govern the flow in each of the network channels. These equations were solved separately for each ditch branch, and the flow depths at the junctions were corrected using the method of characteristics. The model was applied to the drainage network of a peatland catchment in Eastern Finland over a period of 15 months. Because flow resistance in the ditches depended strongly on flow conditions, flow resistance (Manning’s n) was introduced as a function of discharge. The model was calibrated and validated against field data and the simulation results were further applied to assess erosion risk. The highest risk of erosion occurred during long lasting flows induced by snowmelt at ditch sections with a steep slope and a large upstream area. These model results can aid in the design and siting of water protection measures within the drained area.},

In particular, once any such model is instantiated, its running time increases only linearly with the number of grid points used, regardless of the complexity of the network. The algorithms, which are elaborated here for the example of sub-critical flow conditions using computer-algebraic procedures, can be easily applied to urban-drainage and irrigation networks in a physically transparent way.

	abstract = {The spectrum of this survey turns on the evaluation of various existing theoretical combining models, when invoked within the internal boundary condition management at a junction. Based on the assumption that: when the Froude number is low (i.e. the ﬂow is subcritical), the energy equation at the junction can be approximated by the stages heads equality. Actual literature and many commercial packages rather use this concept for the treatment of the junction’s internal boundary handling because it is easy to implement and it avoids the solving of nonlinear equations. In the last decade, many nonlinear combining models, based on the momentum conservation through the junction, have been reported. However, using them to operate within the internal boundary condition treatment of an open-channel conﬂuence has not yet been investigated. Hence, this research focuses on studying the practical aspect of several combining models, once applied within the junction’s internal boundary management. Therefore, the recent nonlinear models of Gurram, Hsu and Shabayek have been brieﬂy detailed together with the traditional concept of assuming water stages equality at the junction. Subsequently, an experimental examination was performed according to available experiments as mean to pre-evaluate (separately at the junction) the four junction models in the steady state. Moreover, according to the latter inspection the attention was constrained to study the eﬀect of high/low subcritical Froude number at the junction. Finally, two hypothetical hydraulic problems were deﬁned and computed in order to exhibit the performance of these junction models when used to contend the junction’s internal boundary handling. The problems involved: (a) steady and transient ﬂows; (b) high and low (subcritical) Froude number at the junction. Supported by the experimental and numerical investigations, it can be concluded that even while the Froude number spectrum is subcritical, precautions have to be taken when dealing with the concept of energy heads equality, notably for a Froude higher than 0.35 at the junction.},

Simple guidelines for determining the spatial and temporal discretizations are provided.

	abstract = {New integral, ﬁnite-volume forms of the {SaintVenant} equations for one-dimensional (1-D) open-channel ﬂow are derived. The new equations are in the ﬂux-gradient conservation form and transfer portions of both the hydrostatic pressure force and the gravitational force from the source term to the conservative ﬂux term. This approach prevents irregular channel topography from creating an inherently non-smooth source term for momentum. The derivation introduces an analytical approximation of the free surface across a ﬁnite-volume element (e.g., linear, parabolic) with a weighting function for quadrature with bottom topography. This new free-surface/topography approach provides a single term that approximates the integrated piezometric pressure over a control volume that can be split between the source and the conservative ﬂux terms without introducing new variables within the discretization. The resulting conservative ﬁnite-volume equations are written entirely in terms of ﬂow rates, cross-sectional areas, and water surface elevations – without using the bottom slope (S0). The new {SaintVenant} equation form is (1) inherently conservative, as compared to non-conservative ﬁnite-difference forms, and (2) inherently well-balanced for irregular topography, as compared to conservative ﬁnite-volume forms using the Cunge–Liggett approach that rely on two integrations of topography. It is likely that this new equation form will be more tractable for large-scale simulations of river networks and urban drainage systems with highly variable topography as it ensures the inhomogeneous source term of the momentum conservation equation is Lipschitz smooth as long as the solution variables are smooth.},

	abstract = {A significant proportion of tropical peatlands has been drained for agricultural purposes, resulting in severe degradation. Hydrological restoration, which usually involves blocking ditches, is therefore a priority. Nevertheless, the influence of ditch blocking on tropical peatland hydrological functioning is still poorly understood. We studied water-level dynamics using a combination of automated and manual dipwells, and also meteorological data during dry and wet seasons over 6 months at three locations in Sebangau National Park, Kalimantan, Indonesia. The locations were a forested peatland (Forested), a drained peatland with ditch dams (Blocked), and a drained peatland without ditch dams (Drained). In the dry season, water tables at all sites were deeper than the Indonesian regulatory requirement of 40 cm from the peat surface. In the dry season, the ditches were dry and water did not flow to them. The dry season water-table drawdown rates — solely due to evapotranspiration —were 9.3 mm {dayÀ}1 at Forested, 9.6 mm {dayÀ}1 at Blocked, but 12.7 mm {dayÀ}1 at Drained. In the wet season, the proportion of time during which water tables in the wells were deeper than the 40 cm limit ranged between 16\% and 87\% at Forested, 0\% at Blocked, and between 0\% and 38\% at Drained. In the wet season, water flowed from the peatland to ditches at Blocked and Drained. The interquartile range of hydraulic gradients between the lowest ditch outlet and the farthest well from ditches at Blocked was 3.7 Â 10À4 to 7.8 Â 10À4 m {mÀ}1, but 1.9 Â 10À3 to 2.6 Â 10À3 m {mÀ}1 at Drained. Given the results from Forested, a water-table depth limit policy based on field data may be required, to reflect natural seasonal dynamics in tropical peatlands. Revised spatial designs of dams or bunds are also required, to ensure effective water-table management as part of tropical peatland restoration.},

Elementary graph theoretical concepts are utilized to choose the iterative flow variables so that the small units can be solved efficiently. The algorithm is computationally more efficient than the direct method using the Newton-Raphson technique by an order of magnitude. It does not involve the solution of large matrix equations. The efficiency of the algorithm is illustrated by solving an example tree-type channel network with 42 nodes, 41 channels, and a total of 429 grid points. The proposed method will also be very useful in the design and optimization of tree-type channel networks.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the Simulation Program for River Networks ({SPRINT}) that is proposed as a tool for studying Continental River Dynamics ({CRD}), the solution of physics-based equations for large-scale river networks. Existing coupled hydrologic/hydraulic models have been unable to solve the full Saint-Venant equations for river networks larger than O(103) elements, but continental scales require 106e107 elements. The new model solves the full nonlinear Saint-Venant equations for one-dimensional (1D) unsteady ﬂow and stage height in river channel networks with non-uniform bathymetry, and is demonstrated to compute networks of O(105) elements more than 330 times faster than real time on a desktop computer. The model incorporates ideas that were originally developed to address Very Large System Integration ({VLSI}) problems in microprocessor design, where solving large nonlinear computational problems is a common challenge. Computational speed is increased by applying Jacobian bypass techniques in a {NewtoneRaphson} solution and smoothing the geometric depth-area and friction-area relationships where discontinuities otherwise slow convergence. Pre-processing of junction relationships is used to remove temporal nonlinearities where river tributaries meet. Model input/output are simpliﬁed and made readily accessible to other software through use of Application Programming Interface ({API}) standards and a “netlist” idea that was previously used to describe electric circuit topology. The model is tested on both simple and complex geometry through comparisons with the {HECRAS} model. A example simulation is conducted for 1.5 Â 104 river km of the Guadalupe and San Antonio river network during a 14 day rain event.},

	abstract = {Linear systems with very large off-diagonal elements and discontinuous coefﬁcients ({LODC} systems) arise in some modeling cases, such as those involving heterogeneous media. Such problems are usually solved by domain decomposition methods, but these can be difﬁcult to implement on unstructured grids or when the boundaries between subdomains have a complicated geometry. Gordon and Gordon have shown that Björck and Elfving’s (sequential) {CGMN} algorithm and their own block-parallel {CARP}-{CG} are very robust and efﬁcient on strongly convection dominated cases (but without discontinuous coefﬁcients). They have also shown that scaling the equations by dividing each equation by the L2-norm of its coefﬁcients, called “geometric row scaling” ({GRS}), improves the convergence properties of Bi-{CGSTAB} and {GMRES} on nonsymmetric systems with discontinuous coefﬁcients, provided the convection terms are only small to moderate. Given a system Ax = b, it is shown that if C is obtained from A by applying {GRS}, then the diagonal elements of {CCT} are larger than the off-diagonal ones, so the normal equations system is manageable. These two operations are inherent in the Kaczmarz algorithm, and hence also in {CGMN} and {CARP}-{CG} (which are {CG}-accelerations of Kaczmarz). It is shown that these two methods are also very effective on systems with discontinuous coefﬁcients derived from strongly convection dominated elliptic {PDEs}. {CGNR} and {CGNE} also beneﬁt greatly from this approach, but they are much less efﬁcient.},

Reliability, a low memory-footprint, and a short solution time are a few of these demands. Currently, no black-box solver exists that can satisfy all criteria. The linear systems from both simulations can be highly ill-conditioned and are, therefore, quite challenging for direct and iterative methods. In this paper, it is shown that algorithms to place large entries on the diagonal using unsymmetric permutations and scalings greatly enhance the reliability of both direct and preconditioned iterative solvers for unsymmetric linear systems arising in semiconductor device and circuit simulations. The numerical experiments indicate that the overall solution strategy is both reliable and cost effective.},

The Rewetting program that aims to rehabilitate hydrologically a peatland to a near natural state is carried out by canal blocking, canal backfilling, and construction of deep wells. To know the progress of the restoration activities by {BRG}, it is very important to understand the effectiveness of canal blocking on rewetting of the tropical peatland. The effectiveness of canal blocking was investigated through the monitoring of groundwater level ({GWL}) fluctuation around the canal block. This study was carried out at a canal block that is located at the peatland of Sungai Tohor Village, Kepulauan Meranti Regency, Riau Province. For monitoring of {GWL} fluctuation as the impact of canal blocking, five dipwells were set at the peatland that are perpendicular to the canal with the distance of 20 m, 70 m, 120 m, 170 m, and 220 m respectively. The results of this study show that the impact of canal blocking could raise the water table in the peatland at the radius of about 170 m from the canal. The radius impact of the rewetting might be bigger or smaller, that strongly depends on the hydrotopography situation of the area.},

	abstract = {Human induced land use change and associated ﬁre alter profoundly the hydrology of tropical peatlands and thus affect the functioning of entire river catchments. The hydrological model {SIMGRO} was used to calculate the effects of drainage on peat water levels, peat surface morphology and river ﬂows within the Air Hitam Laut catchment in Jambi Province, Sumatra, Indonesia. Model outcomes were calibrated and validated using groundwater levels monitored at several sites, discharges measured in the Air Hitam Laut River and ﬂooding patterns derived from remotely sensed Radar images. The validated model was used to predict consequences of three possible scenarios: (i) expansion of oil palm plantations upstream, (ii) expansion of agriculture downstream and (iii) continuing ﬁre damage. Oil palm plantation development results in changes to the drainage pattern of the catchment and reduces its natural extent. Lowered river discharge will have a detrimental affect upon the sustainability of Berbak National Park in the centre of the catchment and reduce prospects for agriculture and ﬁsheries in the coastal zone. Expansion of agriculture downstream causes peat subsidence, resulting in exposure of underlying, acid sulphate soils and intrusion of saline sea water. Continuing ﬁres will increase considerably the area of permanently ﬂooded land and thus constrain peatland restoration options. For peatland restoration to be successful hydrological management must be accompanied by economic measures to improve the livelihoods of local people and by effective law enforcement.},

	abstract = {The use of peatlands in the humid tropics requires drainage to remove excess rainfall. The design principles for the drainage systems currently being implemented on peatlands are the same as for mineral soils. The objective of such systems is the timely removal of excess rainfall by surface runoff. For peatlands, with their different soil-hydraulic characteristics, these systems have resulted in poor watertable control and high rates of irreversible subsidence. Concerns about this rate of subsidence and the level of sustainability of the present land use have prompted a study to develop a new water management system. This new system includes a shift from a drainage system that focuses on discharge of excess water towards a system that combines drainage and water conservation. In the new two-step design, the drain spacing and corresponding drain discharges are obtained with a steady-state approach. These outputs are used to calculate the capacity of the drains, including control structures, using an unsteady-state approach. The new system results in a shallower but more narrowly spaced drainage system and maintains a more constant but relatively high watertable and reduces subsidence. It should be remembered however, that even with the improved water management, subsidence cannot be arrested; it is the price one has to pay for the use of tropical peatlands.},

	abstract = {Two regional groundwater ﬂow models (Neckar catchment, Germany, 14,000 km2, and Southern Oue´me´ Basin, Benin, 11,000 km2) were developed within the framework of the integrated management project ‘{RIVERTWIN}’ (www.rivertwin.org). Both models were evaluated with respect to the question if the chosen modelling approaches (multi-layered ﬁnite diﬀerence numerical ﬂow modelling, steady state and transient) are appropriate in view of the existing management problems in the catchments, the data availability and the hydrogeological and hydrological conditions in the basins. It is shown that neither the model in the well-investigated, data-rich basin in Western Europe with its highly developed water related infrastructure, nor the model in the hydrogeologically less well-known and less developed basin in Western Africa provide results that are fully applicable to the main regional management tasks. In the case of the Oue´me´, the groundwater related problems are foremost of local character and therefore cannot be addressed by regional models in a meaningful way. Data scarcity and complex, unfavourable geological conditions (crystalline rocks, discontinuous aquifers) support the conclusion that numerical 3D groundwater ﬂow models are currently not helpful to manage groundwater related management problems in the Oue´me´ basin. A better understanding of regional hydrological surface and subsurface processes is required ﬁrst. Methods for a reliable estimation of groundwater recharge and subsequently groundwater availability were identiﬁed as the most urgently needed tool for meaningful groundwater management in view of climatic, demographic and land use change. In the Neckar catchment the results of the analysis are less pronounced; here regional groundwater problems could clearly beneﬁt from a physically based 3D model since the hydrogeological system is strictly stratiﬁed with several important aquifers in the vertical sequence. As a general conclusion it can be stated that regional scale groundwater ﬂow modelling concepts seem to be diﬃcult to integrate in management systems and diﬃcult to transfer from one basin to another. This means the question of how to represent the groundwater resources appropriately has to be discussed very thoroughly for any new integrated water resources management problem. It is not possible to give a ﬁnal recommendation on which modelling concept is the most appropriate one in regional integrated modelling and management. Hence, this article is only intended to provide an in depth discussion of the aspects that need to be considered in the process of choosing appropriate modelling concepts.},

	abstract = {Distributed hydrologic models capable of simulating fully-coupled surface water and groundwater ﬂow are increasingly used to examine problems in the hydrologic sciences. Several techniques are currently available to couple the surface and subsurface; the two most frequently employed approaches are ﬁrst-order exchange coefﬁcients (a.k.a., the surface conductance method) and enforced continuity of pressure and ﬂux at the surface-subsurface boundary condition. The effort reported here examines the parameter sensitivity of simulated hydrologic response for the ﬁrst-order exchange coefﬁcients at a well-characterized ﬁeld site using the fully coupled Integrated Hydrology Model ({InHM} ). This investigation demonstrates that the ﬁrst-order exchange coefﬁcients can be selected such that the simulated hydrologic response is insensitive to the parameter choice, while simulation time is considerably reduced. Alternatively, the ability to choose a ﬁrstorder exchange coefﬁcient that intentionally decouples the surface and subsurface facilitates concept-development simulations to examine real-world situations where the surface-subsurface exchange is impaired. While the parameters comprising the ﬁrst-order exchange coefﬁcient cannot be directly estimated or measured, the insensitivity of the simulated ﬂow system to these parameters (when chosen appropriately) combined with the ability to mimic actual physical processes suggests that the ﬁrst-order exchange coefﬁcient approach can be consistent with a physics-based framework.

	abstract = {Coupled modelling of surface and subsurface systems is a valuable tool for quantifying surface water–groundwater interactions. In the present paper, the 3-D non-steady state Navier–Stokes equations, after Reynolds averaging and with the assumption of a hydrostatic pressure distribution, are for the ﬁrst time coupled to the 3-D saturated groundwater ﬂow equations in an Integrated {suRface} {watEr}–{grouNdwater} {modEl} ({IRENE}). A ﬁnite-difference method is used for the solution of the governing equations of {IRENE}. A semi-implicit scheme is used for the discretisation of the surface water ﬂow equations and a fully implicit scheme for the discretisation of the groundwater ﬂow equations. The two sets of equations are coupled at the common interface of the surface water and groundwater bodies, where water exchange takes place, using Darcy’s law. A new approach is proposed for the solution of the coupled surface water and groundwater equations in a simultaneous manner, in such a fashion that gives computational efﬁciency at low computational cost. {IRENE} is veriﬁed against three analytical solutions of surface water–groundwater interaction, which are chosen so that different components of the model can be tested. The model closely reproduces the results of the analytical solutions and can therefore be used for analysing and predicting surface water–groundwater interactions in real-world cases.},

Here, we review the current state of {ISSHM} testing and evaluate the most popular {ISSHM} test cases by comparing the hydrodynamic processes simulated in each case to the processes found in well-characterized, real-world catchments and by comparing their general attributes to those of successful benchmark problems from other ﬁelds of hydrogeology. The review reveals that (1) {ISSHM} testing and intercode comparison have not adopted speciﬁc test cases consistently; (2) despite the wide range of {ISSHM} metrics available for model testing, only two model performance diagnostics are typically adopted: the catchment outﬂow hydrograph and the catchment water balance; (3) in intercode comparisons, model performance is usually judged by evaluating only one performance diagnostic: the catchment outﬂow hydrograph; and (4) {ISSHM} test cases evaluate a small number of hydrodynamic processes that are largely uniform across the model domain, representing a limited selection of the processes of interest in well-characterized, real-world catchments. {ISSHM} testing would beneﬁt from more intercode comparisons using a consistent set of test cases, aimed at evaluating more catchment processes (e.g. ﬂooding) and using a wider range of simulation diagnostics (e.g. pressure head distributions). To achieve this, a suite of test case variations is required to capture the relevant catchment processes. Finally, there is a need for additional {ISSHM} test problems that compare model predictions with hydrological observations from intensively monitored ﬁeld sites and controlled laboratory experiments.

	abstract = {Tropical peatlands cover an estimated 440 000 km2 ({\textasciitilde}10\% of global peatland area) and are signiﬁcant in the global carbon cycle by storing about 40–90 Gt C in peat. Over the past several decades, tropical peatlands have experienced high rates of deforestation and conversion, which is often associated with lowering the water table and peat burning, releasing large amounts of carbon stored in peat to the atmosphere. We present the ﬁrst model of long-term carbon accumulation in tropical peatlands by modifying the Holocene Peat Model ({HPM}), which has been successfully applied to northern temperate peatlands. Tropical {HPM} ({HPMTrop}) is a one-dimensional, nonlinear, dynamic model with a monthly time step that simulates peat mass remaining in annual peat cohorts over millennia as a balance between monthly vegetation inputs (litter) and monthly decomposition. Key model parameters were based on published data on vegetation characteristics, including net primary production partitioned into leaves, wood, and roots; and initial litter decomposition rates. {HPMTrop} outputs are generally consistent with ﬁeld observations from Indonesia. Simulated long-term carbon accumulation rates for 11 000-year-old inland, and 5 000-year-old coastal peatlands were about 0.3 and 0.59 Mg C {haÀ}1 {yrÀ}1, and the resulting peat carbon stocks at the end of the 11 000-year and 5 000year simulations were 3300 and 2900 Mg C {haÀ}1, respectively. The simulated carbon loss caused by coastal peat swamp forest conversion into oil palm plantation with periodic burning was 1400 Mg C {haÀ}1 over 100 years, which is equivalent to {\textasciitilde}2900 years of C accumulation in a hectare of coastal peatlands.},

	abstract = {Generally, the diffusive wave equation, obtained by neglecting the acceleration terms in the Saint-Venant equations, is used in flood routing in rivers. Methods based on the finite-difference discretization techniques are often used to calculate discharges at each time step. A modified form of the diffusivewave equation has been developed and new resolution algorithms proposed which are better adapted to flood routing along a complex river network. The two parameters of the equation, celerity and diffusivity, can then be taken as functions of the discharge. The resolution algorithm allows the use of any distribution of lateral inflow in space and time. The accuracy of the new algorithms were compared with a traditional algorithm by numerical experimentation. Special attention was given to the instability caused by the inflow signal which constitutes the upstream boundary condition. For the fully diffusive wave flood routing problem, all three algorithms tested gave good results. The results also indicate that the efficiency of the new algorithms could be significantly improved if the position of the x-axis is modified by rotation. The new algorithms were applied to flood routing simulation over the Gardon d’Anduze catchment (542 km2) in southern France.},

Parallelization was implemented using {CUDA}-Fortran with an {NVIDIA} {GeForce} {GTX} 1060 {GPU}.

The diﬀusive wave model reproduced the runoﬀ processes of impermeable basins with results similar to those of analytical solutions and the numerical results of a dynamic wave model. For ideal permeable basins containing depressions such as furrows and ponds, physically reasonable rainfall runoﬀ processes were observed. From tests on a real basin with complex terrain, reasonable agreement with the measured data was observed.

	abstract = {Tropical peatlands are an important global carbon (C) store but are threatened by drainage for palm oil and wood pulp production. The store’s stability depends on the dynamics of the peatland water table, which in turn depend on peat permeability. We found that an example of the most abundant type of tropical peatland—ombrotrophic domes—has an unexpectedly high permeability similar to that of gravel. Using computer simulations of a natural peat dome ({NPD}) and a ditch-drained peat dome ({DPD}) we explored how such high permeability affects water tables and peat decay. High permeability has little effect on {NPD} water tables because of low hydraulic gradients from the center to the margin of the peatland. In contrast, {DPD} water tables are consistently deep, leaving the upper meter of peat exposed to rapid decay. Our results reveal why ditch drainage precipitates a rapid destabilization of the tropical peatland C store.},

	abstract = {Many tropical peatlands are subjected to artificial drainage that leads to degradation. Hence, hydrological restoration has recently been prioritized. Nevertheless, as field monitoring data are limited, little is known about how restoration measures, such as ditch dams and bunds, can regulate tropical peatland water tables. We used a hydrodynamic model —{DigiBog}\_Hydro— to simulate the effectiveness of ditch dams and bunds across three El Niño–Southern Oscillation ({ENSO}) scenarios, which are El Niño, La Niña and Neutral, in three typical sites. The sites were moderately degraded (Mod-Dgr) and severely degraded (Sev-Dgr) peatland plots (each 0.2 km2), representing typical peatland conditions in Sebangau National Park, Kalimantan, Indonesia. Our fine-scale (1 m Â 1 m spatial resolution) modelling revealed that in the dry season of any {ENSO} scenario, the significant effects of ditch-dams alone on peatland water-level were limited to lateral distances of 26 m (in Mod-Dgr) and 12 m (in Sev-Dgr) from the ditch. In the dry season of an El Niño year, the combination of ditch dams and bunds helped maintain water levels up to 72 cm (in Mod-Dgr) and 69 cm (in Sev-Dgr) higher than in the no-restoration condition. During the extremedry period of an El Niño year, the bunds reduced the number of days when the water table was deeper than 40 cm in Mod-Dgr and in Sev-Dgr by 50\% and 73\%, respectively. We suggest that bunds used in combination with ditch dams are a practical restoration measure for tropical peatlands, providing critical extra water storage and helping maintain water tables near the peatland surface in dry periods. We also demonstrate how fine-scale hydrodynamic modelling is beneficial for planning and assessment of restoration measures in tropical peatlands.},

The result shows the correlation between Epan with Ep Gleam is higher than Epan with E Gleam. Generally, the accuracy of Gleam data is a good performance to estimate the land evaporation in Java and Bali at annual and monthly scale. In daily scale, the correlation is less than 0.50 both between Epan with E Gleam and between Epan with Ep Gleam. In a daily scale, the average errors ranging from 0.15 to 3.09 mm according to {RMSE}, {MAE}, and {ME}.

A number of restoration initiatives have been attempted to address this degradation yet, to date, there has been little coherent or rigorous reflection on the effectiveness of these interventions. This paper examines the barriers to peatland restoration in Indonesia and reviews the techniques so far used to restore degraded peatland in the tropics. Direct barriers to peatland restoration in Indonesia include altered peat topography, peatland drainage, the presence of invasive ferns and shrub species, repeated fires, and flooding risks. Indirect barriers include climate change, inconsistent land-use policy and lack of alternative livelihood options. We highlight that most restoration activities carried out to date have been small-scale trials and the restoration techniques used have included canal blocking, seedling transplantation, and promotion of seed dispersal. We suggest that successful peatland restoration in Indonesia is as much dependent on meaningful land use policy and governance reform as it is on the technical effectiveness of specific restoration methods.},

The purpose of the weir construction in this area is to keep the water level of canals high and to prevent the outﬂow of groundwater from peatlands. The ﬁeld investigation was carried out to identify the types and reasons of the damages on the weirs which were already constructed on the canal. The undisturbed peat samples carefully taken by using the thin-wall sampler were used to determine the physical parameters of the peat. The sampling rates of peat columns were more than 90 \%. The unconﬁned compressive strength of peat in this site was 3,2 {kN}/m2. The weir should be strong mechanically and hydrologically during dry and wet seasons. The weir has a spillway of which the overﬂow width and depth are 10 m and 0.3 m respectively. The slope of the embankment is 2:1 with wooden supports. The weir structure is divided into two zones, a water blockade zone and an erosion protection zone. The clay soil is used for the water blockade zone and the sand bags are used for the erosion protection zone. The erosion protection zone can prevent the destruction by permeation of water. Clay and sandy soils can be procured locally.},

	abstract = {Drainage canals associated with logging and agriculture dry out organic soils in tropical peatlands, thereby threatening the viability of long-term carbon stores due to increased emissions from decomposition, fire, and fluvial transport. In Southeast Asian peatlands, which have experienced decades of land use change, the exact extent and spatial distribution of drainage canals are unknown. This has prevented regional-scale investigation of the relationships between drainage, land use, and carbon emissions. Here, we create the first regional map of drainage canals using high resolution satellite imagery and a convolutional neural network. We find that drainage is widespread—occurring in at least 65\% of peatlands and across all land use types. Although previous estimates of peatland carbon emissions have relied on land use as a proxy for drainage, our maps show substantial variation in drainage density within land use types. Subsidence rates are 3.2 times larger in intensively drained areas than in non-drained areas, highlighting the central role of drainage in mediating peat subsidence. Accounting for drainage canals was found to improve a subsidence prediction model by 30\%, suggesting that canals contain information about subsidence not captured by land use alone. Thus, our data set can be used to improve subsidence and associated carbon emissions predictions in peatlands, and to target areas for hydrologic restoration.},

	abstract = {Sebangau National Park is a tropical peat swamp forest previously used for logging activities (illegal and legal) between the 1970s until 2006. Logging activities created the canal networks used for transportation of logs and led to over-drainage in peatland. Two-hundred and seventy three canals were recorded over a total length of 673.486 km in nine locations at the Sebangau National Park. Restoration of degraded peatland area started by rewetting peatland using canal blocking technique in which the dam increases the water table level. This technique was implemented in the Bulan River, Katingan Catchment, southwest of Sebangau National Park. The location of canal blocking were determined using canal elevation, estimated every 25 cm by combining field survey and imagery data from digital terrain model. Final decision on canal blocking was reached through compromised discussions with the villagers in order for them to understand the aims of canal blocking and to come to an agreement with the beneficiaries of non-timber forest products and fisheries around the affected area. The canal blocking have resulted in 645 dams being built along the 92 canals with total length measuring 226 km. Measurement impacts of canal blocking were monitored by monthly data of surface water level (swl) in 16 locations and groundwater level (gwl) in 112 pipes for the period from June 2013 to July 2015. The analysis shows that canal blocking effect is significantly positively correlated with water level controlled by rainfall (p {\textless} 0.05). The positive impact after the canal blocking is on the increase of swl (mean of swl: before = -33.966 cm, after = -26.099 cm; rainfall = 191.0398 mm) and gwl (mean of gwl: before = -19.442 cm, after = -11.925 cm; rainfall = 191.0398 mm). Other efforts that should be done to promote restoration include peat fire prevention, reforestation and community involvement.},

The degraded peatlands with massive canalization are very vulnerable against peat fire especially in the dry season. A pilot project for water management was conducted at Tanjung Leban, Bengkalis Regency, Riau Province with the purpose not only for hydrological restoration but also for fire prevention. In 2013, 2014, and 2015, the big peat fires occurred at Tanjung Leban and many peatland areas in Riau which caused a haze disaster. Peatland restoration and peat fire prevention efforts have been continuously undertaken by Peatland Restoration Agency and stakeholders at Tanjung Leban and many peatland areas in Riau. The rewetting, revegetation, and revitalization of livelihood were the integrated approaches that were carried out to support the peatland restoration. The aim of this research is to monitor the hydrological condition as the impact of rewetting activities using canal blocking at Tanjung Leban. Forty dip wells in four transects and an automatic rainfall record equipment were set up in the research area to monitor the groundwater level ({GWL}) and the rainfall event as the impact of rewetting activities. The result shows that the rewetting activity using canal blocking has a significant impact on the rewetting effort so that the risk of peat fire can be minimized. The historical evidence shows that the peatland restoration has been improving after the peatland areas were kept in always wet conditions.},

	abstract = {In the ﬁrst of this pair of papers we introduced the conceptual and hydrological basis of the peatland development model—{DigiBog}. Here we describe the submodels which simulate (i) the production of plant litter, (ii) peat decomposition, and (iii) changes in peat hydraulic conductivity due to decomposition. To illustrate how the model works, {DigiBog} was applied to three example situations: Bogs 1, 2, and 3. For each, the net rainfall was held constant at 30 cm year 1 and the oxic decomposition parameter kept at 0Ð015 year 1. The anoxic decomposition parameter varied from 5 ð 10 6 (Bog 1) to 5 ð 10 4 year 1 (Bog 3). Peatland development was simulated for 5000 years. For Bogs 1 and 2, plausible large peatland domes develop. Despite having a higher anoxic decomposition rate, Bog 2 grew thicker than Bog 1. This apparently counterintuitive result is caused by the feedback between hydraulic conductivity and degree of peat decomposition. For both Bogs 1 and 2, {DigiBog} also simulates transitions from wet to dry states, demarked by sudden switches from poorly decomposed to well-decomposed peat moving upwards in the peat proﬁle. These regime shifts result from internal peatland dynamics and not from allogenic inﬂuences, and challenge the view that peat properties are always a reﬂection of climate. In Bog 3, a ‘mini-bog’ developed and persisted near the margin of the peatland; this bog can also be explained in terms of the internal feedbacks within the model.

This study investigated the factors controlling the {CO}2 efflux and quantified the annual cumulative {CO}2 emissions through soil respiration and heterotrophic respiration, which is equivalent to oxidative peat decomposition. Soil respiration was measured in close-to-tree ({\textless}2.5m, {CT}) and far-from-tree ({\textgreater}3m, {FT}) plots, and heterotrophic respiration was measured in root-cut ({RC}) plots by a trenching method. The daily mean {CO}2 efflux values (mean±1 standard deviation) were 2.80±2.18, 1.59±1.18, and 1.94±1.58μmolm−2s−1 in the {CT}, {FT}, and {RC} plots, respectively. Daily mean {CO}2 efflux increased exponentially as the groundwater level or water-filled pore space decreased, indicating that oxidative peat decomposition and gas diffusion in the soil increased due to enhanced aeration resulting from lower groundwater levels. Mean annual gap-filled {CO}2 emissions were 1.03±0.53, 0.59±0.26, and 0.69±0.21kgCm−2 yr−1 in the {CT}, {FT}, and {RC} plots, respectively. Soil {CO}2 emissions were significantly higher in the {CT} plots (P{\textless}0.05), but did not differ significantly between the {FT} and {RC} plots. This implies that root respiration was negligible in the {FT} plots. Heterotrophic respiration accounted for 66\% of soil respiration. Annual {CO}2 emissions through both soil and heterotrophic respiration were smaller than those of other oil palm plantations on tropical peat, possibly due to the higher groundwater levels, land compaction, and continuous measurement of soil {CO}2 efflux in this study. Mean annual total subsidence was 1.55 to 1.62cmyr−1, of which oxidative peat decomposition accounted for 72 to 74\%. In conclusion, water management to raise groundwater levels would mitigate soil {CO}2 emissions from oil palm plantations on tropical peatland.},

	abstract = {The form and functioning of peatlands depend strongly on their hydrological status, but there are few data available on the hydraulic properties of tropical peatlands. In particular, the saturated hydraulic conductivity (K) has not previously been measured in neotropical peatlands. Piezometer slug tests were used to measure K at two depths (50 and 90 cm) in three contrasting forested peatlands in the Peruvian Amazon: Quistococha, San Jorge and Buena Vista. Measured K at 50 cm depth varies between 0.00032 and 0.11 cm {sÀ}1, and at 90 cm, it varies between 0.00027 and 0.057 cm {sÀ}1. Measurements of K taken from different areas of Quistococha showed that spatial heterogeneity accounts for {\textasciitilde}20\% of the within-site variance and that depth is a good predictor of K. However, K did not vary signiﬁcantly with depth at Buena Vista and San Jorge. Statistical analysis showed that {\textasciitilde}18\% of the variance in the K data can be explained by between-site differences. Simulations using a simple hydrological model suggest that the relatively high K values could lead to lowering of the water table by {\textgreater}10 cm within {\textasciitilde}48 m of the peatland edge for domed peatlands, if subjected to a drought lasting 30 days. However, under current climatic conditions, even with high K, peatlands would be unable to shed the large amount of water entering the system via rainfall through subsurface ﬂow alone. We conclude that most of the water leaves these peatlands via overland ﬂow and/or evapotranspiration. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Peat surface {CO}2 emission, groundwater table depth and peat temperature were monitored for two years along transects in an Acacia plantation on thick tropical peat ({\textgreater}4 m) in Sumatra, Indonesia. A total of 2300 emission measurements were taken at 144 locations, over a 2 year period. The autotrophic root respiration component of {CO}2 emission was separated from heterotrophic emission caused by peat oxidation in three ways: (i) by comparing {CO}2 emissions within and beyond the tree rooting zone, (ii) by comparing {CO}2 emissions with and without peat trenching (i.e. cutting any roots remaining in the peat beyond the tree rooting zone), and (iii) by comparing {CO}2 emissions before and after Acacia tree harvesting. On average, the contribution of autotrophic respiration to daytime {CO}2 emission was 21\% along transects in mature tree stands. At locations 0.5 m from trees this was up to 80\% of the total emissions, but it was negligible at locations more than 1.3 m away. This means that {CO}2 emission measurements well away from trees were free of any autotrophic respiration contribution and thus represent only heterotrophic emissions. We found daytime mean annual {CO}2 emission from peat oxidation alone of 94 t ha−1 y−1 at a mean water table depth of 0.8 m, and a minimum emission value of 80 t ha−1 y−1 after correction for the effect of diurnal temperature fluctuations, which may result in a 14.5\% reduction of the daytime emission. There is a positive correlation between mean long-term water table depth and peat oxidation {CO}2 emission. However, no such relation is found for instantaneous emission/water table depth within transects and it is clear that factors other than water table depth also affect peat oxidation and total {CO}2 emissions. The increase in the temperature of the surface peat due to plantation establishment may explain over 50\% of peat oxidation emissions. Our study sets a standard for greenhouse gas flux studies from tropical peatlands under different forms of agricultural land management. It is the first to purposefully quantify heterotrophic {CO}2 emissions resulting from tropical peat decomposition by separating these from autotrophic emissions. It also provides the most scientifically- and statistically-rigorous study to date of {CO}2 emissions resulting from anthropogenic modification of this globally significant carbon rich ecosystem. Our findings indicate that past studies have underestimated emissions from peatland plantations, with important implications for the scale of greenhouse gas emissions arising from land use change, particularly in the light of current, rapid agricultural conversion of peatlands in the Southeast Asian region.},
