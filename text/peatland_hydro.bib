	abstract = {We developed and applied a computational model for simulating unsteady flow in a drainage network of a boreal forested peatland site. The input to the model was the hourly runoff produced by a hydrological model. The simulations of the flow in the ditch network were performed using an iterative procedure for solving the Saint-Venant equations that govern the flow in each of the network channels. These equations were solved separately for each ditch branch, and the flow depths at the junctions were corrected using the method of characteristics. The model was applied to the drainage network of a peatland catchment in Eastern Finland over a period of 15 months. Because flow resistance in the ditches depended strongly on flow conditions, flow resistance (Manning’s n) was introduced as a function of discharge. The model was calibrated and validated against field data and the simulation results were further applied to assess erosion risk. The highest risk of erosion occurred during long lasting flows induced by snowmelt at ditch sections with a steep slope and a large upstream area. These model results can aid in the design and siting of water protection measures within the drained area.},

	abstract = {Drained peatlands are one of the main sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions globally. Emission reduction and, more generally, ecosystem restoration can be enhanced by raising the water table using canal or drain blocks. When restoring large areas, the number of blocks becomes limited by the available resources, which raises the following question: in which exact positions should a given number of blocks be placed in order to maximize the water table rise throughout the area? There is neither a simple nor an analytic answer. The water table response is a complex phenomenon that depends on several factors, such as the topology of the canal network, site topography, peat hydraulic properties, vegetation characteristics and meteorological conditions. We developed a new method to position the canal blocks based on the combination of a hydrological model and heuristic optimization algorithms. We simulated 3 d dry downs from a water saturated initial state for different block positions using the Boussinesq equation, and the block conﬁgurations maximizing water table rise were searched for by means of genetic algorithm and simulated annealing. We applied this approach to a large drained peatland area (931 km2) in Sumatra, Indonesia. Our solution consistently outperformed traditional block locating methods, indicating that drained peatland restoration can be made more effective at the same cost by selecting the positions of the blocks using the presented scheme.},

Gleam combines a wide range of remotely sensed observations to estimate the terrestrial evaporation and root-zone soil moisture at a global scale (0.25-degree). The aim is to assess the accuracy of Gleam data by examining correlation, mean absolute error, Root means square error and mean error between Epan and Gleam data in Java and Bali Island. The result shows the correlation between Epan with Ep Gleam is higher than Epan with E Gleam. Generally, the accuracy of Gleam data is a good performance to estimate the land evaporation in Java and Bali at annual and monthly scale. In daily scale, the correlation is less than 0.50 both between Epan with E Gleam and between Epan with Ep Gleam. In a daily scale, the average errors ranging from 0.15 to 3.09 mm according to RMSE, MAE, and ME. The result of this study is essential in providing a valuable recommendation for choosing alternative evaporation data in a regional or local scale from satellite data.},

	abstract = {Many tropical peatlands are subjected to artificial drainage that leads to degradation. Hence, hydrological restoration has recently been prioritized. Nevertheless, as field monitoring data are limited, little is known about how restoration measures, such as ditch dams and bunds, can regulate tropical peatland water tables. We used a hydrodynamic model —DigiBog\_Hydro— to simulate the effectiveness of ditch dams and bunds across three El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) scenarios, which are El Niño, La Niña and Neutral, in three typical sites. The sites were moderately degraded (Mod-Dgr) and severely degraded (Sev-Dgr) peatland plots (each 0.2 km2), representing typical peatland conditions in Sebangau National Park, Kalimantan, Indonesia. Our fine-scale (1 m Â 1 m spatial resolution) modelling revealed that in the dry season of any ENSO scenario, the significant effects of ditch-dams alone on peatland water-level were limited to lateral distances of 26 m (in Mod-Dgr) and 12 m (in Sev-Dgr) from the ditch. In the dry season of an El Niño year, the combination of ditch dams and bunds helped maintain water levels up to 72 cm (in Mod-Dgr) and 69 cm (in Sev-Dgr) higher than in the no-restoration condition. During the extremedry period of an El Niño year, the bunds reduced the number of days when the water table was deeper than 40 cm in Mod-Dgr and in Sev-Dgr by 50\% and 73\%, respectively. We suggest that bunds used in combination with ditch dams are a practical restoration measure for tropical peatlands, providing critical extra water storage and helping maintain water tables near the peatland surface in dry periods. We also demonstrate how fine-scale hydrodynamic modelling is beneficial for planning and assessment of restoration measures in tropical peatlands.},

The store’s stability depends on the dynamics of the peatland water table, which in turn depend on peat permeability. We found that an example of the most abundant type of tropical peatland—ombrotrophic domes—has an unexpectedly high permeability similar to that of gravel. Using computer simulations of a natural peat dome (NPD) and a ditch-drained peat dome (DPD) we explored how such high permeability affects water tables and peat decay. High permeability has little effect on NPD water tables because of low hydraulic gradients from the center to the margin of the peatland. In contrast, DPD water tables are consistently deep, leaving the upper meter of peat exposed to rapid decay. Our results reveal why ditch drainage precipitates a rapid destabilization of the tropical peatland C store.},

	abstract = {A significant proportion of tropical peatlands has been drained for agricultural purposes, resulting in severe degradation. Hydrological restoration, which usually involves blocking ditches, is therefore a priority. Nevertheless, the influence of ditch blocking on tropical peatland hydrological functioning is still poorly understood. We studied water-level dynamics using a combination of automated and manual dipwells, and also meteorological data during dry and wet seasons over 6 months at three locations in Sebangau National Park, Kalimantan, Indonesia. The locations were a forested peatland (Forested), a drained peatland with ditch dams (Blocked), and a drained peatland without ditch dams (Drained). In the dry season, water tables at all sites were deeper than the Indonesian regulatory requirement of 40 cm from the peat surface. In the dry season, the ditches were dry and water did not flow to them. The dry season water-table drawdown rates — solely due to evapotranspiration —were 9.3 mm dayÀ1 at Forested, 9.6 mm dayÀ1 at Blocked, but 12.7 mm dayÀ1 at Drained. In the wet season, the proportion of time during which water tables in the wells were deeper than the 40 cm limit ranged between 16\% and 87\% at Forested, 0\% at Blocked, and between 0\% and 38\% at Drained. In the wet season, water flowed from the peatland to ditches at Blocked and Drained. The interquartile range of hydraulic gradients between the lowest ditch outlet and the farthest well from ditches at Blocked was 3.7 Â 10À4 to 7.8 Â 10À4 m mÀ1, but 1.9 Â 10À3 to 2.6 Â 10À3 m mÀ1 at Drained. Given the results from Forested, a water-table depth limit policy based on field data may be required, to reflect natural seasonal dynamics in tropical peatlands. Revised spatial designs of dams or bunds are also required, to ensure effective water-table management as part of tropical peatland restoration.},

	abstract = {Drainage canals associated with logging and agriculture dry out organic soils in tropical peatlands, thereby threatening the viability of long-term carbon stores due to increased emissions from decomposition, fire, and fluvial transport. In Southeast Asian peatlands, which have experienced decades of land use change, the exact extent and spatial distribution of drainage canals are unknown. This has prevented regional-scale investigation of the relationships between drainage, land use, and carbon emissions. Here, we create the first regional map of drainage canals using high resolution satellite imagery and a convolutional neural network. We find that drainage is widespread—occurring in at least 65\% of peatlands and across all land use types. Although previous estimates of peatland carbon emissions have relied on land use as a proxy for drainage, our maps show substantial variation in drainage density within land use types. Subsidence rates are 3.2 times larger in intensively drained areas than in non-drained areas, highlighting the central role of drainage in mediating peat subsidence. Accounting for drainage canals was found to improve a subsidence prediction model by 30\%, suggesting that canals contain information about subsidence not captured by land use alone. Thus, our data set can be used to improve subsidence and associated carbon emissions predictions in peatlands, and to target areas for hydrologic restoration.},

The purpose of the weir construction in this area is to keep the water level of canals high and to prevent the outﬂow of groundwater from peatlands. The ﬁeld investigation was carried out to identify the types and reasons of the damages on the weirs which were already constructed on the canal. The undisturbed peat samples carefully taken by using the thin-wall sampler were used to determine the physical parameters of the peat. The sampling rates of peat columns were more than 90 \%. The unconﬁned compressive strength of peat in this site was 3,2 kN/m2. The weir should be strong mechanically and hydrologically during dry and wet seasons. The weir has a spillway of which the overﬂow width and depth are 10 m and 0.3 m respectively. The slope of the embankment is 2:1 with wooden supports. The weir structure is divided into two zones, a water blockade zone and an erosion protection zone. The clay soil is used for the water blockade zone and the sand bags are used for the erosion protection zone. The erosion protection zone can prevent the destruction by permeation of water. Clay and sandy soils can be procured locally.},

A number of restoration initiatives have been attempted to address this degradation yet, to date, there has been little coherent or rigorous reflection on the effectiveness of these interventions. This paper examines the barriers to peatland restoration in Indonesia and reviews the techniques so far used to restore degraded peatland in the tropics. Direct barriers to peatland restoration in Indonesia include altered peat topography, peatland drainage, the presence of invasive ferns and shrub species, repeated fires, and flooding risks. Indirect barriers include climate change, inconsistent land-use policy and lack of alternative livelihood options. We highlight that most restoration activities carried out to date have been small-scale trials and the restoration techniques used have included canal blocking, seedling transplantation, and promotion of seed dispersal. We suggest that successful peatland restoration in Indonesia is as much dependent on meaningful land use policy and governance reform as it is on the technical effectiveness of specific restoration methods.},

	abstract = {In the ﬁrst of this pair of papers we introduced the conceptual and hydrological basis of the peatland development model—DigiBog. Here we describe the submodels which simulate (i) the production of plant litter, (ii) peat decomposition, and (iii) changes in peat hydraulic conductivity due to decomposition. To illustrate how the model works, DigiBog was applied to three example situations: Bogs 1, 2, and 3. For each, the net rainfall was held constant at 30 cm year 1 and the oxic decomposition parameter kept at 0Ð015 year 1. The anoxic decomposition parameter varied from 5 ð 10 6 (Bog 1) to 5 ð 10 4 year 1 (Bog 3). Peatland development was simulated for 5000 years. For Bogs 1 and 2, plausible large peatland domes develop. Despite having a higher anoxic decomposition rate, Bog 2 grew thicker than Bog 1. This apparently counterintuitive result is caused by the feedback between hydraulic conductivity and degree of peat decomposition. For both Bogs 1 and 2, DigiBog also simulates transitions from wet to dry states, demarked by sudden switches from poorly decomposed to well-decomposed peat moving upwards in the peat proﬁle. These regime shifts result from internal peatland dynamics and not from allogenic inﬂuences, and challenge the view that peat properties are always a reﬂection of climate. In Bog 3, a ‘mini-bog’ developed and persisted near the margin of the peatland; this bog can also be explained in terms of the internal feedbacks within the model.

	abstract = {Water management is an important aspect of hydrological restoration and fire prevention in tropical peatland because the availability of water is not well distributed in the dry and rainy seasons. The degraded peatlands with massive canalization are very vulnerable against peat fire especially in the dry season. A pilot project for water management was conducted at Tanjung Leban, Bengkalis Regency, Riau Province with the purpose not only for hydrological restoration but also for fire prevention. In 2013, 2014, and 2015, the big peat fires occurred at Tanjung Leban and many peatland areas in Riau which caused a haze disaster. Peatland restoration and peat fire prevention efforts have been continuously undertaken by Peatland Restoration Agency and stakeholders at Tanjung Leban and many peatland areas in Riau. The rewetting, revegetation, and revitalization of livelihood were the integrated approaches that were carried out to support the peatland restoration. The aim of this research is to monitor the hydrological condition as the impact of rewetting activities using canal blocking at Tanjung Leban. Forty dip wells in four transects and an automatic rainfall record equipment were set up in the research area to monitor the groundwater level (GWL) and the rainfall event as the impact of rewetting activities. The result shows that the rewetting activity using canal blocking has a significant impact on the rewetting effort so that the risk of peat fire can be minimized. The historical evidence shows that the peatland restoration has been improving after the peatland areas were kept in always wet conditions.},

	abstract = {Sebangau National Park is a tropical peat swamp forest previously used for logging activities (illegal and legal) between the 1970s until 2006. Logging activities created the canal networks used for transportation of logs and led to over-drainage in peatland. Two-hundred and seventy three canals were recorded over a total length of 673.486 km in nine locations at the Sebangau National Park. Restoration of degraded peatland area started by rewetting peatland using canal blocking technique in which the dam increases the water table level. This technique was implemented in the Bulan River, Katingan Catchment, southwest of Sebangau National Park. The location of canal blocking were determined using canal elevation, estimated every 25 cm by combining field survey and imagery data from digital terrain model. Final decision on canal blocking was reached through compromised discussions with the villagers in order for them to understand the aims of canal blocking and to come to an agreement with the beneficiaries of non-timber forest products and fisheries around the affected area. The canal blocking have resulted in 645 dams being built along the 92 canals with total length measuring 226 km. Measurement impacts of canal blocking were monitored by monthly data of surface water level (swl) in 16 locations and groundwater level (gwl) in 112 pipes for the period from June 2013 to July 2015. The analysis shows that canal blocking effect is significantly positively correlated with water level controlled by rainfall (p {\textless} 0.05). The positive impact after the canal blocking is on the increase of swl (mean of swl: before = -33.966 cm, after = -26.099 cm; rainfall = 191.0398 mm) and gwl (mean of gwl: before = -19.442 cm, after = -11.925 cm; rainfall = 191.0398 mm). Other efforts that should be done to promote restoration include peat fire prevention, reforestation and community involvement.},

	abstract = {Soil carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux was measured continuously for two years using an automated chamber system in an oil palm plantation on tropical peat. This study investigated the factors controlling the CO2 efflux and quantified the annual cumulative CO2 emissions through soil respiration and heterotrophic respiration, which is equivalent to oxidative peat decomposition. Soil respiration was measured in close-to-tree ({\textless}2.5m, CT) and far-from-tree ({\textgreater}3m, FT) plots, and heterotrophic respiration was measured in root-cut (RC) plots by a trenching method. The daily mean CO2 efflux values (mean±1 standard deviation) were 2.80±2.18, 1.59±1.18, and 1.94±1.58μmolm−2s−1 in the CT, FT, and RC plots, respectively. Daily mean CO2 efflux increased exponentially as the groundwater level or water-filled pore space decreased, indicating that oxidative peat decomposition and gas diffusion in the soil increased due to enhanced aeration resulting from lower groundwater levels. Mean annual gap-filled CO2 emissions were 1.03±0.53, 0.59±0.26, and 0.69±0.21kgCm−2 yr−1 in the CT, FT, and RC plots, respectively. Soil CO2 emissions were significantly higher in the CT plots (P{\textless}0.05), but did not differ significantly between the FT and RC plots. This implies that root respiration was negligible in the FT plots. Heterotrophic respiration accounted for 66\% of soil respiration. Annual CO2 emissions through both soil and heterotrophic respiration were smaller than those of other oil palm plantations on tropical peat, possibly due to the higher groundwater levels, land compaction, and continuous measurement of soil CO2 efflux in this study. Mean annual total subsidence was 1.55 to 1.62cmyr−1, of which oxidative peat decomposition accounted for 72 to 74\%. In conclusion, water management to raise groundwater levels would mitigate soil CO2 emissions from oil palm plantations on tropical peatland.},

	abstract = {The form and functioning of peatlands depend strongly on their hydrological status, but there are few data available on the hydraulic properties of tropical peatlands. In particular, the saturated hydraulic conductivity (K) has not previously been measured in neotropical peatlands. Piezometer slug tests were used to measure K at two depths (50 and 90 cm) in three contrasting forested peatlands in the Peruvian Amazon: Quistococha, San Jorge and Buena Vista. Measured K at 50 cm depth varies between 0.00032 and 0.11 cm sÀ1, and at 90 cm, it varies between 0.00027 and 0.057 cm sÀ1. Measurements of K taken from different areas of Quistococha showed that spatial heterogeneity accounts for {\textasciitilde}20\% of the within-site variance and that depth is a good predictor of K. However, K did not vary signiﬁcantly with depth at Buena Vista and San Jorge. Statistical analysis showed that {\textasciitilde}18\% of the variance in the K data can be explained by between-site differences. Simulations using a simple hydrological model suggest that the relatively high K values could lead to lowering of the water table by {\textgreater}10 cm within {\textasciitilde}48 m of the peatland edge for domed peatlands, if subjected to a drought lasting 30 days. However, under current climatic conditions, even with high K, peatlands would be unable to shed the large amount of water entering the system via rainfall through subsurface ﬂow alone. We conclude that most of the water leaves these peatlands via overland ﬂow and/or evapotranspiration. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
